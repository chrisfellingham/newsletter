Hi all!

Welcome to 2017! I'm returning to the new year with a slightly longer than usual report to compensate for the Christmas break. Furthermore I should hopefully be wringing through some changes based on the feedback in the next couple of months and probably a name change (for the report, just to be clear :) )  
  
As ever if you enjoy it **[SHARE IT](https://tinyletter.com/ChrisFellingham)! **if you have any thoughts **please** write back to me  
 

All views expressed in these reports are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of FutureLearn.

 

How did MOOCs do in 2016? Quite well

A slew of ‘year in reviews’ came out from Class-central and the various MOOC platforms providing some useful updates but largely confirming existing trends:

Programming and English Language stay top of the MOOC pops - Programming, Data Science, English and Machine Learning cropped up on Coursera and edX top courses lists. Meanwhile, LinkedIn’s top in-demand skills included: Cloud and Distributed Computing, Mobile development, User Interface Design and Data Science - In short, people are upskilling for a tech job and learning english if it isn’t their first language to enable them to do so -  [here](https://qz.com/867728/tech-and-english-indians-are-going-online-to-nail-down-two-skills-to-advance-their-careers/), [here](http://blog.edx.org/10-most-popular-courses-edx-courses-in-2016?track=blog), [here](http://coursera.tumblr.com/post/154812914287/the-most-popular-courses-of-2016) and [here](https://blog.linkedin.com/2016/10/20/top-skills-2016-week-of-learning-linkedin)

Who were the MOOC users of 2016? - Class Central reports that  58m people have taken MOOCs from 700+ universities bringing the total number of MOOCs to 6,850. Most interesting was that around a quarter of the users came from ‘regional MOOCs’ namely XuetangX in China and Miríada X for Spanish speaking countries. Miríada X have capitalised on pre-existing university links between Spain and Latin America as well as evident demand to learn in Spanish. XuetangX’s has similarly capitalised on language demand and the value of taking courses from domestic university brands   - [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/moocs-stats-and-trends-2016/)

edX revealed their own demographics: USA  24%, India 11%, UK 4%, Brazil 4%, China 3% , Canada 3% , Mexico 3%, Spain 2% Australia 2% and Colombia 2% but also a nearly 2:1 ratio of male to female - [here](http://blog.edx.org/year-review-edx-2016?track=blog)

State of the MOOCS

Udacity add foundation degrees to deepen their control of tech education - Udacity’s Nanodegrees already provided a profitable funnel of tech courses designed to get people into IT jobs and in 2016 they took this a step further with Blitz, their job placement program.

Udacity’s latest product is the foundation degree, which aims to plug the gap of those wishing for a career in tech but for whom Nanodegrees are too difficult. Udacity will  see Foundation degrees as addressing a market gap and as a lead generator for their Nanodegrees. They should also help close the loop to make Udacity a one-stop shop for tech careers.

Udacity add Deep Learning Foundation degree - Foundation degrees as has already been noted are primarily aimed at beginners  looking to get into challenging Computer Science subjects. However they may also be useful in emerging economies where the quality of higher education can vary such as India. The foundation degree not only provides an additional product but onboards learners for the more expensive full Nanodegree. The foundation is relatively cheap at $399 and completion guarantees a place on selective Nanodegrees. The degree is being taught by YouTube star Siraj Raval - who promotes learning in Artificial Intelligence. Going for a YouTube star could be a new approach to marketing, however it may also mean they failed to find a corporate partner - [here](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/13/udacity-launches-deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation-program/)

Udacity’s job placement programme builds steam with some illustrious new partners - Udacity’s Blitz, which was launched last year, has added further employers. The programme provides Nanodegree graduates with short paid project work from companies who can then hire the graduate. That more companies are signing on is probably more indicative of the demand for these skills than proof of the quality of a Nanodegree graduate (since the program hasn’t been running long) but if Udacity can build on this it’s a huge draw for their product in general.

New joiners: Intel, Amazon Alexa, Auro, Bosch, CrowdAI, Dataspeed, HARMAN, Lucid VR, Mobvoi, Nod, Samsung, Slack, Telefónica Germany ,Upload- [here](http://blog.udacity.com/2016/12/meet-new-udacity-hiring-partners.html)

Udacity have also launched Udacity Connect Intensive - like Udacity Connect it uses physical locations but instead of 12 months it takes only 3 - 5 hours of in-person classes on saturdays and 10 hours personal study time. At the moment it’s only available for Machine Learning Nanodegree, so this is probably a trial to test if there is demand for this format - [here](https://www.udacity.com/uconnect/intensive)

Udacity appoint Ishan Gupta to head their Indian expansion -  Ishan Gupta,  founder of Indian education platform Edukart and VP of mobile commerce platform paytm. Since their launch, Udacity have seen a five-fold expansion in their Indian audience - [here](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/hr-leadership/people/online-education-provider-udacity-appoints-ishan-gupta-as-india-md/articleshow/56467919.cms)

Georgia Tech launches Online Masters of Analytics (OMA) with edX - After their modestly successful Online Masters of Computer Science with Udacity, Georgia Tech will launch a new online masters with edX. The course will cost $10,000 (vs $36K-49K on campus)  and consists of 10 courses plus a capstone which takes a semester. Three of the courses will be available as a MicroMasters. It’s a win-win for both sides, for the university they create a lower cost tier of their masters at a higher volume (they traditionally only accept around 70 per year on campus). edX will in return get a Micromasters that will both capture revenue and act as a lead generator for the online masters - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/12/georgia-tech-launches-second-low-cost-online-masters-degree-program)

World Bank Group and University of Wellington (NZ) join edX. - The latter will run a series of K-12 courses reflecting a recent finding that 32% of edX’s users are or were teachers - [here](https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2017/01/students-and-teachers-reap-benefits-of-uq-edx-and-microsoft-partnership) and [here](http://blog.edx.org/edx-welcomes-world-bank-group?track=blog)

University of Michigan go all in on MOOCs, aiming to have 200 on-campus courses as MOOCs by the end of 2017 - The university whose courses appear on both Coursera and edX has had a total of 5.3m enrolments to date with 250 staff involved. Michigan cite that in addition to the the revenue from the MOOCs the strategy has raised research awareness, allowed on-campus blended courses and been used to help high schoolers prepare for university - [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/the-university-of-michigan-bets-big-on-moocs/)

 

Edtech

Three cheers for Class Central, who are nearly financial sustainable - The MOOC aggregator site is close to sustainability after a pleasant cocktail 5 year cocktail of ad revenues, affiliation fees and strong user growth. It’s indicative of the strength of the freemium online learning market that an aggregator can sustain itself, one suspects they’ll be looking to further monetise their data and premium media content to sell to providers - [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/class-central-2016-review/)

IBM Watson is coming for Edtech - Penn State Network, the incubator for educators and Edtech startups is to host a contest for the best Edtech idea using the Business AI platform - IBM Watson. Watson has already been used for Edtech through its [Pearson Partnership](https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/50842.wss) but has also been involved in: [replacing insurance workers in Japan](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3001855/ibm-watson-replaces-34-staffers-at-japanese-insurance-firm), [DNA Testing for Cancer Patients](http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2017/01/09/illumina-adds-ibm-watson-to-dna-test-for-cancer-patients/#747cf985163e) and working with the [US Food and Drug Administration on Cancer Research](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-watson-health-fda-partner-224710892.html), nothing to worry about then - [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/01/09/penn-state-pushes-use-of-ibm-watson-to-improve-student-experiences.aspx?admgarea=news)

LinkedIn data shows the rise in alternative credentials - LinkedIn claim that alternative credentials are on the rise and are increasingly being recognised by learners and employers alike. LinkedIn do have some data to support this but it shouldn’t be considered a revelation, a proliferation of suppliers and learners will invariably have raised employer awareness the question is -  to what extent do employers value them? - [here](http://www.hrdive.com/news/the-top-in-demand-workforce-skills-for-2017/433729/)

LinkedIn’s project management course hits 745K learners  - The course is provided by the Project Management Institute and costs $800 dollars but is only available after a few years of experience in project management. LinkedIn’s own data has shown it leads to a 20% salary rise-  [here](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/12/technology/project-management-linkedin/)

Canvas announce a partnership with Credly (both owned by Instructure) to enable digital badges on all their courses, the badges can be displayed on LinkedIn - [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/01/09/credly-badges-now-available-through-canvas.aspx?admgarea=news)

RateMyProfessor survey demonstrate demonstrates underlying biases - RateMyProfessor, an online platform that allows students to rate their professors across a score of metrics from teaching ability to attractiveness. In RateMyProfessor’s latest report, based on 7.9m reviews they find that: Students that found a subject easier rated professors more highly - meaning STEM professors often receive worse reviews. More attractive professors are correlated with better scores and female professors fare worse than male professors. Some credit should be given to them because by summarising the data (rather than users just looking for individual professors) they are at least flagging structural biases in their product but one questions whether more accountability is justified - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/13/study-online-ratings-professors-suggest-scores-vary-instructors-gender-and-perceived)

9.5m LinkedIn Lynda accounts hacked - Which is embarrassing - perhaps a course on Cybersecurity is required - [here](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3001438/linkedin-s-lyndacom-is-hacked-95-million-accounts-affected)

 

Edtech Finance

IDP Education purchase Hotcourses for £30.1m - IDP Education, the Australian student placement service has purchased Hotcourses, an online directory site for students looking to find university courses to apply to. Hotcourses receives 66m hits per year and has 2m users on its database. IDP who announced their launch into [job placements](https://thepienews.com/news/idp-employers-in-student-journey/) last year will see this primarily as a marketing funnel - students searching for courses can now be sold onto IDP services such as student placement, support services (while studying) and then job services (post study) all through the IDP - [here](https://thepienews.com/news/idp-education-acquires-hotcourses-group/)

EdTech Investment Fund ReThink Education raises $107.5m in capital -  The move is notable because Edtech funding dropped significantly in 2016 (~30% down on previous year). ReThink argued the market was still strong but required patience as Edtech startups spend longer in seed funding and incubation. ReThink also argued the future lies with platforms that provide both the content and the assessment, as well as credentialing services - [here](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-01-10-rethink-education-re-ups-commitment-to-edtech-with-107-5-million-fund)

Indian exam preparation startup Unacademy raises $4.5m - The startup, which predominantly teaches through YouTube, has 200+ educators who prepare students for exams - a very popular area for online education in India (EduKart and Toppr). Popular educators earn more. The startup has taken advantage of YouTube’s move towards subscription revenue shares and intend to use the money to develop an Android App - [here](https://yourstory.com/2017/01/unacademy-raises-series-a-funding/)

UNICAF receives $12m to fund expansion in Africa - The online degree provider for professionals in Africa raised money from Savannah Fund and the CDC Group.  To date, 8K people have used it, with degrees varying in cost but officially “20% of a degree in the West”. They hope to use the expansion to push into hard to reach areas such as Somalia - [here](https://thepienews.com/news/africa-unicaf-receives-12m-investment/)

 

OPM (Online Programme Management) & LMS (Learning Management systems)

Cengage launches English Language Teacher training in Saudi Arabia - Cengage, a Boston based OPM, teamed up with Tatweer, a Saudi government-owned educational development company to deliver training for 1,000 English language teachers. Cengage follows in the footsteps of Pearson, who signed a teacher training deal in 2014 and Udacity who opened up a Udacity Connect (offline mentoring support for their users) also in conjunction with a Saudi government charity.

Why the fuss? Saudi Arabia has a young population (median age 25) and is slowly transitioning itself towards a knowledge economy - as they can no longer rely on bumper oil revenues. This transition will require more teachers, more english and in terms of skills more tech skills - hence these deals. However it ought to be noted that recent deals seem to be in partnership with Saudi government organisations or charities - a possible prerequisite for business in the kingdom - [here](https://thepienews.com/news/cengage-t4edu-elt-training-saudi-arabia/)

George Mason University sign 10 year deal with OPM provider Wiley - The  deal will see Wiley handle every part of the value chain (marketing, recruitment, retention, support) except course production. The focus will be on masters in: Business, Health Systems Management, Health Informatics and Teaching  (with a focus on disabilities) -  [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/01/11/george-mason-u-to-boost-online-graduate-programs-through-wiley-partnership.aspx?admgarea=news)

Laureate raises $383m from stock sale ahead of IPO - The private university provider aims to IPO after holding off during the financial market tumults of the last 2 years. Laureate run universities globally but have particular strength in the americas their investors include Apollo Global Management and education publisher McGraw-Hill - [here](https://thepienews.com/news/laureate-education-raises-383m-ipo-plans/)

INTO University partner with Washington state university to expand international student reach - [here](https://thepienews.com/news/into-partners-with-washington-state-university/)

 

International Education

Plus Alliance collaboration to launch shared courses and degrees - Plus alliance,  consisting of King’s College London, Arizona State University and University of New South Wales have formed an alliance to share staff, research and now degrees. The aim is to expose students to different learning styles and collectively widen the offering for all students. The main challenge has been the fee structure, as US fees are typically far higher than UK and Australian equivalents. If this all sounds familiar that's because it has some echoes of edX’s partners who are piloting a credit sharing offering of their MOOCs among several members - [here](https://thepienews.com/news/tri-continental-university-partnership-plus-alliance-launches-first-degrees/)

East African higher education credits to be jointly recognised - The move means students can more easily transfer and have their studies recognised within the region. Participating countries are: Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda. The region as a whole is rapidly emerging as an economic hub on the continent so linking up education systems was a logical precursor to enabling business and labour market integration. It follows an [announcement](https://thepienews.com/news/pan-african-passport-could-ease-student-mobility/) last year by the African Union to make studying within the continent easier - [here](https://thepienews.com/news/east-african-community-become-harmonised-he-region/)

France aims to attract 10K Indian students by 2020 up from 4K presently - French Minister Ayrault suggested it would help build trade ties with the emerging economy. As with East Africa, many see education links as a lead generator for future business interest but it also reflects the need for the French HE system to generate more funds through international students -  [here](https://thepienews.com/news/france-aims-to-attract-10000-indian-students-by-2020/)

HEPI (Higher Education Policy Institute) launches critique of global ranking reports - The London based think tank argued there were strong methodological flaws with the likes of QS and THE world rankings ([here](http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20161215001420225)) Citing:

- Universities submitted the data themselves without the submissions being audited 
- The use of data scrapes (where crawlers extract the data from sites which aren’t always adequately updated) 
- Over-reliance on research rankings 
  

UKHE (UK Higher Education)

How many people are coming to study in the UK? From which countries? A HESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency) report showed a slight dip in non-EU students enrolling in the UK primarily due to the strong drop in Indian students. Top sending countries are China, surprise entrant Malaysia followed by the US and India, Hong Kong students also grew significantly over the 2 years. Top EU sending countries were Germany followed by France. Part time students were also down (5%) while in terms of subjects studied STEM subjects saw continued growth - [here](https://thepienews.com/news/hesa-uk-he-international-eu-enrolments/) and [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/overseas-student-enrolments-uk-universities-fall-again)

Brexit update:

As for Brexit, London economics, commissioned by Kaplan a for-profit education provider and HEPI (Higher Education Policy Institute) estimate hard Brexit could see 31K less students come to study in the UK (a combination of fees and visa issue) resulting in the UK losing £2bn a year. Not all clouds, top universities such as Oxford and Cambridge whose demand outstrips supply could make more money as EU students will be switched to full international fees - [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/overseas-student-enrolments-uk-universities-fall-again),  [here](https://thepienews.com/news/uk-eu-international-students-hepi-kaplan-study/)

  

Tangents

MOOCs and the future of lifelong learning - In a special report, the Economist looks at the history and future of education for the workforce.

They argue that the link between a college degree and future earnings has been decoupling, this is critical as policymakers in all countries have focused on expanding access to university education as a means of social mobility and creating a competitive future workforce.

The argument is that between 1980 and 2000 computers became prevalent across businesses in every sector, which increased the demand for ‘cognitive skills’ i.e. the critical thinking etc that universities developed - this demand was a key part of the wage premium from degrees (~8-13% per year of college education). Now computers are prevalent, demand has plateaued and so to some extent has the wage premium.

Although some areas that use IT intensively such as tech companies still see job growth, other parts of the economy no longer generate as many jobs for college graduates. The college graduates still get jobs - but usually by displacing those without a college degree and which tend to pay less hence the decoupling of the college degree and the wage premium. Furthermore, automation has been replacing jobs entirely, or at least aspects of a job - employees, the Economist argues, need new skills to take advantage of the changes in the company. The problem is this comes at a time of falling investment in employee training.

MOOCs, General Assembly et al could be the solution. By providing short, cheaper and flexible online courses they fit well into the life of a busy professional looking to re-skill and by making them short and online it’s easier for them to pivot to new skills (e.g Machine Learning) as they come in vogue.

Problem solved? Not quite. As Milton Friedman the nobel-winning economist argued in his famous essay on Higher Education, college education also allows employers to differentiate between candidates. Originally when higher education was limited, employers could distinguish graduate from non-graduate, as access widened rankings helped differentiate among graduates. What then of MOOCs etc which serve tens of thousands? The economist argues the key will lie in standardised testing and credentially - touting the likes of CodeFights (covered previously) and other Edtech startups that can differentiate.

The key example that came out this month and was cited by the Economist was Singapore, who in 2016 launched their Skillfuture program that provides a 500 Singapore dollar stipend for Singaporeans over 25 to conduct further study. It’s a perfect example for the Economist because it’s a highly liberal economy providing a supply side solution to the problem of low-wage jobs.

Singapore however, is both the proof and the flaw in the Economist’s argument. As a small city state with a low-tax knowledge economy this policy might well be effective but the idea that re-training will guarantee well paying jobs is less realistic in more diverse economies like the UK or the US. A recent book by Robert Reich, Secretary of Labour under Bill Clinton acknowledges that the re-training programs used in the 1990s to help industrial workers facing closures in the face of globalisation failed. The high school graduates of the industrial towns were either unable to retrain or there were no jobs for them to train into anyway.

This ought to be a warning  - education as a supply side solution cannot be a panacea for the ills for the economy - it needs as Robert Reich conceded to be coupled by the creation of jobs for those skills to match  - [here ](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/126000-learn-new-skills-using-skillsfuture-credit), [here](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21714169-technological-change-demands-stronger-and-more-continuous-connections-between-education), [here](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21714173-alternative-providers-education-must-solve-problems-cost-and) and [here](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/12/17/robert-reich-challenging-oligarchy/)
