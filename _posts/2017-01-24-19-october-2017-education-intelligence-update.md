**Hi all**  
  
Welcome to issue #2 of the fortnightly intelligence updates.  
   
As ever, please do get in touch if you have any queries, suggestions or dare I say it, spot an inaccuracy.  
  
_All views expressed in these reports are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of FutureLearn._  
   
**The big stories**

- The successful trial of the iMBA on Coursera is further evidence MOOC platforms can make a successful business model of full online degree programs
- UTexas looks to take on the LMS market through a joint project with Salesforce to develop and scale their existing LMS
 

**MOOCS**

- **‘We seem to have tapped into a market where people were completely underserved” The case for online degrees as the MOOC business model** - University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne (UIUC) aims to expand its iMBA run on Coursera after strong revenue and international enrolment figures
    - **Full course figures**: 270 people signed up for the full iMBA at $22K, 80 people paid $1,000 to have the MOOCs accredited
    - **MOOCs only**: 950K took the MOOCs of which 27K (2.7%) paid to have their course verified (~£59 per course) - the combined revenue is around $7.6m)

- This is the second big success along with Georgia Tech’s  but ought to be compared with ASU’s more mixed results ([here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/12/21/323-learners-eligible-credit-moocs-arizona-state-u)). One wonders if the difference is the product - being able to take the whole product is something people will pay for - taking single credit courses may not make much sense for those not in Higher Ed - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/10/07/growth-illinoiss-mooc-powered-mba-degree-exceeds-universitys-expectations) - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/files/iMBA%20enrollments%20and%20retentions10-4-16.pdf)
- **Coursera deepen their ties with India as the country becomes their second biggest source of revenue**
- India was already the second largest source of learners (1.5m of their 21m users) but due to the popularity of particularly Business and Management, Data Science and Technology courses it has replaced the UK as their #2 source of revenue
- Coursera have doubled down on India and have signed up with Manipal Global. Manipal Global provide a number of professional courses (from CIMA qualifications to Google Marketing). Coursera already have strategic partnerships with Times of India who took part in Coursera’s last funding round. The move will see Coursera courses offered via Manipal’s site and deepen Coursera’s exposure to the vast Indian professional learner market - [here](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/coursera-and-manipal-global-tie-up-for-curated-educational-content/articleshow/54547362.cms) and [here](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/india-is-courseras-2nd-biggest-revenue-earner/articleshow/54559438.cms)
- **Udemy have partnered with Careers24 one of the biggest career portals in South Africa**. Why? Like India the African e-learning market is set to grow at 16.3% year on year and Careers portals are an excellent way to match courses with premium demand
 

**EdTech**

- **The degree will be disaggregated according to a poll of educators** - In a University World News webinar on the role of technology in education 48% said degrees would disaggregate. The sample was far from scientific (n=191 although a number of key universities were there such as University of Pennsylvania) - [here](http://www.dreducation.com/2016/10/webinar-future-internationalization-online-technology.html)
- Stackable credentials also received some nuanced criticism. A recent study looked at 11 healthcare pathways (entries to degrees where the credits can individually add up to a degree regardless of the institution). The study found that although stackable credentials helped people stay in education longer, they didn’t always lead to higher earnings. The issue is acute in the US as stackable credentials are more geared towards low-income learners who may need to work part time or drop out of study for periods and thus the importance of delivering ROI is critical - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/10/12/stackable-credential-pathways-can-lead-short-term-certificates-questionable-value)
- **Auto-marking language-capability prose is getting closer** - Cambridge English are now marking English language papers using cloud based machine learning. The algorithms are able to detect the quality of english and even provide feedback - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/cambridge-english-offers-free-writing-feedback-online/)
- The machine learning marking is built off recent advances in natural language processing and in the medium term has major implications not least for online learning providers who are limited by what assessments they can ‘mark’ at scale. Automating even parts of this can dramatically increase the value to the learner at a fixed cost (the technology)  rather than a variable cost (paying people to mark)
- **Campus technology survey finds 55% faculty have flipped some or all of their courses** - The survey of 524 faculty members across institutions(US only) with an average student size of 13K found that over half had flipped (where flipping was defined as asking students to view digital material at home to increase hands on activity in the classroom). It also found a further 25% intended to flip - [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/10/12/55-percent-of-faculty-are-flipping-the-classroom.aspx)
- Not covered in the survey but of equal interest is which material the teachers are using and how? edX have noted teachers prominence in their userbase ditto FutureLearn - [here](http://blog.edx.org/are-we-missing-opportunities-engage?track=blog)
- **Digital natives learn digitally (no surprise but here are some facts) - **A Deloitte survey of US classrooms found a number of interesting trends when asked about technology in their school:
    - 75% teachers believe (physical) textbooks will be gone within 10 years
    - 67% use online educational videos, 65% use educational apps or software and 52% use games
    - 90% kids do some form of digital learning at home - [here](http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/digital-education-survey.html)

- **Online proctoring to be used by 1,000-2,000 US institutions by the end of 2016** - Eduventures note that 28% of US students already take at least one online course and so the demand for online proctoring would naturally follow - [here](http://www.eduventures.com/2016/10/placebo-effect-online-proctoring/)
 

**Edtech Finance**

- **EdTech’s 4 year growth streak set to finish in 2016** - CBInsights are reporting that despite a late pick up 2016 is set to be less than 2015. It’s not all bad - the main reason for the 2016 drop is a lack of ‘megadeals’ such as the huge Lynda purchase by LinkedIn - [here](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/ed-tech-quarterly-funding-trends-q316/)
 

**OPM (Online Programme Management)**

- **UTexas joins forces with cloud CRM giant Salesforce to become a new LMS provider** - UTexas - long a pioneer in Edtech has partnered with Salesforce to build out their LMS platform TEx (which stands for ‘Total Education experience’  but also one suspects, Texas)
    - It was piloted last year for their competency based programs and will now expand to use blockchain technology, personalised learning and to be a ‘marketplace of courses’ (and a host of other buzzwords [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-gamma/breaking-iron-triangle))
    - **Is a university developed LMS a USP? **UTexas feel it is, noting change will come not from ‘VC-backed Edtech’ but from universities. Certainly being a university brings credibility - but whether they are operationally capable of persisting with this product to scale it and provide capital as other resources compete for university funding is debatable
    - **Is a Salesforce developed LMS a USP? ** Quite possibly, I suggested a while back that cloud-based CRM systems could lend themselves to universities - Salesforce seem willing to try. Notably Salesforce are using their philantrhopic arm - salesforce.org which could be a way to dip their toe in the water to test commercial viability. Positives - software development capacity, negatives - is a system geared to sales effective as an LMS? - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/10/03/u-texas-system-salesforce-team-build-out-learning-platform)

- **Noodle Partners and John Katzman have raised $4m to help colleges deliver online programmes** - The is effectively an OPM provider as they’ll cover creating and designing online courses, student recruitment and student support
- Noodle Partners was created by the founder of Princeton review (which provides student recruitment services to universities) and John Katzman formerly worked at 2U. The deal has one twist - they’ll only charge setup fee + flat fee per student rather than a % of tuition fees - [here](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/12/noodle-partners-raises-4-million-to-help-colleges-deliver-degrees-online/)
- **US News and Shorelight Education team up to form new recruitment portal** - US News (which compiles the US university rankings) and Shorelight Education which focuses on student recruitment for non-profit universities have partnered to create a student portal to help students apply for universities - [here](http://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press-room/articles/2016-10-05/us-news-and-shorelight-education-launch-us-news-global-education)
- The fit is so obvious it’s a wonder US News hadn’t done this previously. In effect US News’ rankings bring the traffic and Shorelight will help commodify it. If it works don’t be surprised if QS et al copy - and if that works don’t be surprised if niche ranking providers come e.g. science, IT etc to carve out specialist rankings and according recruitment channels
 

**UKHE (UK Higher Education)**

- **Clarity no closer for UKHE as what the UK government giveth with one hand it taketh with the other**
    - **The good (for UKHE)** - The UK government has guaranteed EU students starting in 2017-18 funding for the duration of the course. A new committee examining the impact of Brexit on UKHE is being set up by pro-EU MP Neil Carmichael which could provide a boost to UKHE in its bid to protect itself
    - **The bad** - However at virtually the same time (at the Conservative party conference) Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a crack-down on student visas. Rudd proposes visas will be handed out according to the quality of the institution - possibly using the TEF rankings. The move means the government remains committed to a) considering students as part of overall immigration and b) that it will seek to reduce international students in absolute terms. Christina Slade, Vice Chancellor of Bath Spa University notes this move could result in a two-tier system of universities allowed and not allowed to seek international students
    - **The ugly** - In a slightly self-fulfilling prophecy the Hindustan Times of India noted Amber Rudd’s speech would make the UK a less attractive place to study - the brand damage of Brexit many forewarned does appear to be taking place
    - None of these developments are surprising  - as Simon Marginson of UCL’s Centre for Global Higher Education noted - if the government is willing to ignore the City of London then it can ignore the financially smaller HE sector  - [Here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/england-guarantees-funding-eu-students-starting-courses-next-year), [here](http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coming-soon-more-curbs-on-uk-student-visa/story-pQcvqgLzlM38ZMXPm2zSPL.html), [here](http://www.smh.com.au/world/students-foreign-workers-targeted-under-uk-migrant-crackdown-20161004-gruyk3.html), [here](http://wonkhe.com/blogs/comment-two-tier-tier-4-system-damage/) and [here](http://thepienews.com/news/uk-launches-inquiry-into-impact-of-he-post-brexit/)

- **UK Universities shift from selection to recruitment ** - The WonkHE article argues that the uncapping of student numbers and raising of fees means only a handful of universities have been able to increases fees AND increase numbers. The rest need to recruit and they’ve done this by increasing their offer rate (which also means lowering their offer threshold). This forces other universities to respond in kind. This has led to a ‘buyer’s market where offers include freebies such as iPads, football tickets and an increase in student recruitment - [here](http://wonkhe.com/blogs/analysis-he-market-for-hopes-and-dreams-at-ucas-on-results-day/)
- A buyer’s market should result in UK universities expanding their capabilities in student marketing and recruitment - giving platforms that have a high degree of student learner traffic - like say, a MOOC platform, an opportunity to be part of the solution
- **CIPD suggests UK Graduate market is saturated** - The report cites a number of occupations which it says don’t require degrees now being dominated by graduates (such as the police), that the average debt is now £44k and that 45% of these are estimated to never be paid off - [here](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/11/huge-increase-in-number-of-graduates-bad-for-uk-economy)
- Part of the solution should be in hand with the government’s apprenticeship scheme due to formally roll out in April 2017. This should provide a lower cost alternative to the degree.
- The assumption of the CIPD report ought not to go entirely unchallenged - cost is a related but separate issue from supply and one could also flip the argument on its head; it’s not that there are too few graduates it’s that the UK economy has produced too few graduate jobs.
 

**International Education**

- **German language school Sprachschaffe acquires iST  - an agency to help international students study in Germany.** This is a logical vertical integration in the same vein as Rutgers and King’s Education (in the last report) - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/germany-sprachcaffe-buys-ist-travel-agency/)
- **Young People think tank pushes for Higher Ed reforms in the US** - Young Invincibles - a think tank focusing on young people issues has pushed for more data in US higher ed on student outcomes and  more alternate pathways for degrees - [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/10/06/a-million-students-push-for-postsecondary-data-reform.aspx?admgarea=news)
- This report is interesting because it shows support for alternative pathways e.g.  programming schools from outside the sector not just from its providers
- **Gordon Brown launches PEER - a platform for refugees and displaced people to find scholarship and other education opportunities - **[here](http://thepienews.com/news/1m-committed-to-education-platform-for-displaced-students/)
- **EU wide student housing investment reached £1.45bn this year according to Savills** - although the UK was the highest continental growth is increasing as more countries seek to capture a share of the international student market - [here](http://www.educationinvestor.co.uk/(A(0H1T08BR0QEkAAAANDFlNGRkNGUtNjI0ZS00ZWZkLWE4ZTAtNjFkM2VmNDJhY2VhAY8vNesawM7fyKOuS6ednRZMNno1)S(4hydv0afqc0wfubaqodbtm45))/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=5691)
   
**Of ranks and tables**

- **Forbes compile first list of top US colleges for international expansion** - Babson college is top, MIT was 5th and all the Ivy league made the top 100. The rankings included: student satisfaction, student debt and graduate satisfaction - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/forbes-ranks-best-us-colleges-for-intl-students/)
- **Which European country’s HE is the fairest of them all? Norway!** - StudyPortals a site to help study in europe conducted their annual survey with Norway top  and UK 5th - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/norway-scores-highest-for-international-student-satisfaction/)
**Internationalisation**

- **Ireland aims to further internationalise its HE sector** - Ireland is aiming for 15%(currently 8.8%) of tertiary students to be international by 2020 and english language training students to increase by 25%. This is expected to raise €2bn in revenue focusing on: US, China, India, Brazil, Malaysia, Gulf region as well as SE Asia
- **Brazil HE preparing its students for the international market** - A British Council report of over 45 institutions (covering over 0.5m students) had over 600 courses available in English - pointing to the scale of english as a medium in Brazil - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/more-than-600-english-courses-offered-by-brazilian-heis/)
- **Belgium prepares its first English undergraduate degree** - Vrijie Universiteit Brussel and Ghent have combined to create a international bachelors in social science. It’s part aimed at the large international community in Brussels and partly with one eye on capturing more of the western european market - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/10/06/two-universities-belgium-join-forces-english-language-bachelors-program)
- **Russia looks to… stop internationalisation?** Propel 5-100 the Russian plan to put 5 universities in the global top 100 through further funds, consolidation and more international staff and students may be on the rocks after the newly appointed minister suggested the program may not be continued. The consolidations in particular have led to lay-offs and met with strong resistance - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/russia-uncertainty-over-future-of-project-5-100/) It’s a timely reminder of how HE is so often linked to politics
 

**A little extra to read (if the above did not satiate you)**

- Audrey Watters has written up her thoughts on chatbots as tools in education. (hint - not good) but for what it’s worth I think Audrey is unduly negative - as she concedes herself if chatbots can replace basic TA functions (answering basic questions, posting about course schedules and deadlines) then the time saving functions alone is beneficial to TAs - [here](http://hackeducation.com/2016/09/14/chatbot)
- Julian Garritzmann interviews with InsideHigherEd on his new book that explores the political economy of Higher Ed across the OECD since the second world war. The book argues the key factors in what HE system a country has are which countries were in power at the critical time (just after WW2) and for how long. He notes the US system was defined more by economic liberals in its construction but the generous student support was a product of the Democratic party’s time in charge - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/28/author-discusses-his-new-book-political-economy-higher-education-finance)
