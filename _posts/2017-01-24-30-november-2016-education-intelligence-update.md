Udacity, again. Their new recruitment tool Blitz (a curious name choice) allows graduates to be recruited directly from the platform as they aim to capture the full user journey from aspiration to job placement. It caps a strong 12 months for the company with a valuation of $1bn and a profit forecasted at $24m. It’s not just Udacity after recruitment with two more startups tackling the market along with LinkedIn.

The other big story was EC English whose new online platform is the latest in the English language market to go online (Duolingo were first).

 

State of the MOOCS

Udacity launch ‘Blitz’ to help small businesses recruit - After a pilot, a group of initially 80 small businesses can now recruit Nanodegree graduates from Udacity. Contracts vary from 1 person for a week to a small group e.g. 5 for 6 months. Udacity take 10-20% of the contract but critically take no fee or share of income if the graduate is then hire full time.

Why small businesses? Small firms have less resources to invest in hiring and the cost of a poor fit is proportionally higher. Udacity are hoping to solve both the problem of finding talent and de-risk the hire itself through a paid, try before you buy approach.

More gimmick than business model? George Anders at Forbes thinks the revenues will be too low and it mainly serves to add credence to the Nanodegree. Possibly, but companies as large as [Google](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-google-hires-people-2013-6?IR=T) struggle to recruit. Even if the risk of a bad hire is lower, Google would likely be happy to pay a large access fee for a pipeline of reliable talent. Just as  their content strategy based on [predicted software skills shortages](http://mckinseyonsociety.com/sebastian-thrun-udacity-credentials-that-work/), Udacity’s hiring is based on an assumption about labour markets, present and future. Udacity are betting that freelancing or the ‘[gig economy](http://venturebeat.com/2016/11/17/udacity-blitz-engineers-gig-economy/)’  will continue to grow and that a source of reliable talent will be a valuable commodity in such a labour market - [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/technology/udacity-an-online-learning-start-up-offers-tech-job-trials.html?_r=0) and [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2016/11/17/udacity-launches-blitz-helping-its-grads-to-win-jobs/#c828d9058e77)

Udacity Connect launches in Saudi Arabia with support from MiSK foundation - Udacity Connect, a subscription offer for Nanodegree students which allows them to participate in tutor-led, in-person groups in their city has launched in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, has become [more targeted](http://monitor.icef.com/2016/02/report-saudi-scholarship-programme-to-sharpen-focus-on-top-universities/) with its government scholarships as diminishing oil revenues reduce the state’s largesse. To Udacity’s benefit, Computer Science is a strategic area (the primary aim of which is to diversify the economy as oil revenues decline) and the lower costs compared with sending students abroad undoubtedly adds to Udacity’s appeal- [here](http://blog.udacity.com/2016/11/hello-saudi-arabia-alsalamo-alekom-saudi-arabia.html)

OpenLearning create new vocational skills platform - OpenLearning, run by the Open University Australia seek to capitalise on the growing need for vocational skills, a [1bn (AUD](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/23/international-education-20-billion-industry-australia)) export industry. It will likely target emerging markets, earlier this year several Australian providers signed [a deal](http://thepienews.com/news/aus-consortium-to-help-with-india-upskilling/) with the Indian state of Kerala for vocational learning. Courses will be free to take and premium to certify and include courses such as Leadership and Management (1500 AUD, 6-8 courses) - [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/openlearning-learn-com-au/)

NovoEd appoint Ed Miller as CEO - Ed Miller formerly of Blackboard, Xythos and DataHero becomes CEO. While his interview was virtually meaningless, Ed Miller is likely to double down on the B2B business model where they appear to be excelling (they count IDEO and the bank ING among their partners) - [here](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-11-16-on-the-hotseat-7-questions-for-novoed-s-new-ceo-ed-miller)

 

Edtech

EC launch a new online English language platform - The platform, Fusion, will commence courses in January 2017 and focus on Executive English, charging $2-3K, far cheaper than EC’s in-person equivalent. Courses will be self-paced and use adaptive learning. EC already teaches around 45K students per year. 

This is the second major online English push this year, Duolingo were the [first](http://thepienews.com/news/duolingo-develops-english-certification/) (attacking IELT and TOEFL) with a mass market product. EC have chosen to go for the high margin low volume - Executive education - both are online, both will challenge existing providers on cost by cherry picking areas they think are lucrative, leaving the the lower margin english teaching to existing providers - the model of disruption. The success (or not) of EC and Duolingo will be crucial in shaping the language market. The move also poses strategic challenges to generalist MOOC platforms, who are at risk of being hollowed out by specialists that can optimise marketing, business models and platform features to their subject area - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/ec-unveils-online-learning-platform/)

LinkedIn Learning - right place, right time - Linked have unveiled more of their strategy for LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda). LinkedIn aim to target the gap between a job seeker’s profile and the job they apply for (assuming they do it on LinkedIn). By advertising the learning course at this stage in the user journey they hope to capitalise on the urgency and fit in order to get the user to pay as well as ensuring the whole process takes place on their platform. They will use job search data to plug gaps in their course portfolio. The strategy, as Phil Hill at Chronicle suggests is not without its flaws. LinkedIn Learning’s simple video pedagogy is well suited to ‘low-order skills’ but less so to the knowledge intensive skills that are predicted to make up the future workforce - [here](http://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Netflix-for-Education-/238469)

Microcredentials, plenty to see here - Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn is the latest to suggest the degree as a singular credential won’t last. Weiner’s argument is twofold: vocational skills are underrated (and he knows just where you can fix that problem) and that degree don’t provide enough information of a candidate’s skills. The second point in particular has merit, as more job searching and recruitment goes online and indeed is automated, granular information will be a prerequisite of algorithmic discoverability - [here](http://er.educause.edu/blogs/2016/11/postsecondary-trending-now-microcredentials-and-the-higher-ed-hype-cycle) and [here](http://www.nasdaq.com/article/you-wont-believe-what-linkedin-inc-ceo-jeff-weiner-said-about-college-degrees-cm711645)

Penn State create on-campus Edtech incubator - Penn State’s idea is  to make Edtech more appropriate to HE needs, they’ll create an on-campus incubator that can tap into faculty expertise and trial on students. The move follows in the footsteps of Edtech accepting that they may have something to learn from HE before they replace it - a theme at recent Arizona State University’s Edtech conference. If nothing else, it may offer Penn State a chance for equity in potentially profitable Edtech startups - [here](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-11-22-why-partnerships-not-vc-funding-alone-will-ensure-continued-edtech-innovation)

Establishment tech giants are waking up to education - Apple first, from 5-11 December Apple’s hour of code will be extended to 1 week across 500 stores globally. Courses will cover basic Computer Science and Swift. Likely this is defensive PR, as Microsoft unveiled their own education product, Minecraft for Education. The popular game’s education arm has launched in 50 countries and will charge schools $5 per student per year to help children build teamwork, creativity and problem solving skills  - [here](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/apple-hour-of-code-2016/) and [here](http://venturebeat.com/2016/11/01/minecraft-education-edition-launches-in-50-countries/)

General Assembly lays off 50 people (7% work force) as it pivots to business training - (July 2016) The pivot is a surprise, their headlines came from offering upskilling people to graduate programming jobs but evidently the money is in B2B where they estimate 50% of future revenue will come from courses include: Agile Training, User experience, Big Data and they count Viacom and Pearson as clients - [here](http://www.inc.com/tess-townsend/coding-school-startup-general-assembly-lays-off-50.html)

MIT becomes the latest university to consider the future of its libraries - A recent report on the future of the MIT libraries by Chris Bourg highlights the challenges and opportunities that await these august study spaces. Following on from Georgia Tech who moved 95% of their books to storage to free up space, Bourg’s report sees the library move towards a service model to support students and the public alike. 

If reports on the need for permanent learning in knowledge economies are true, then public and university libraries with their prime real estate could create new service models for workforces looking for quiet spaces ideal for studying- [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/23/massachusetts-institute-technology-invites-academe-collaborate-future-libraries).

 

Edtech Finance

Two funding rounds showcase tech’s assault on recruitment - Codefights raised $10m in a Series A funding round. Codefights pits coders into competitions against bots, or other coders then opens the results to employers to hire the winners. The idea is to move beyond University and CV to a raw meritocratic contest. They count Uber, Dropxbox, Asana and Quora among their partners and have doubled revenue in each of the 4 months prior to funding.

Handshake, which raised $20m in a Series B funding round, works by creating a social platform for each university that employers can create profiles on and connect with the students. Handshake has 170 universities (with 200 more in the pipeline) 3m students and 100K companies and non-profits. Although it pitches itself as connecting employers and graduates, the platform is really systemising alumni relations (many of whom will become the future employers of the graduates) a market with high potential as this brief has covered before - [here](http://venturebeat.com/2016/11/17/codefights-raises-10-million-round-to-expand-its-platform-for-testing-coding-skills-of-potential-hires/) and [here](http://joinhandshake.com/announcement/2016/11/17/series-b.html)

City & Guilds purchase e3learning from the Open University Australia - e3learning, specialises in e-learning and compliance across healthcare, government and aviation. City and Guilds also purchased a stake in online training company Filtered (March 2016) - [here](https://blog.linkedin.com/2016/10/20/top-skills-2016-week-of-learning-linkedin)

 

 

OPM (Online Programme Management) & LMS (Learning Management systems)

University of Florida Online (UF Online) shows modest success and ambitions post Pearson - After ejecting Pearson as a provider, UF Online have posted their figures for the year. UF Online has 400 courses, a 70% year on year increase in student numbers and a profit of $66k (modest but they don’t need to share it with Pearson). Although less than the heady ambition of the initial project, UF Online’s program challenges the notion that the turnkey OPM model is the only way to deliver large scale programs.

UF Online’s new target for 2019/20, aims for 6.5K students (down from 24K) of which 11%(down from 43%) will be out of state students the latter of whom pay higher fees and thus will help make the program profitable. University of Florida are responding to state legislature pressure to create cheaper and more flexible Higher education. The median age of online students is 28, suggesting UF Online has been successful in allowing adults to combine work and study but as the report suggests more needs to be done to make it appealing to recent high school graduates who also wish to work and study - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/15/u-florida-online-looks-ahead-after-canceling-deal-pearson)

2U forecast 30% year on year growth as they impress analysts - 2U, the OPM platform hosted its first analyst day - designed to showcase their business model to investors. In addition to their growth they argued the market fundamentals were strong as Universities lacked budget, expertise and the risk appetite to develop online programs themselves. 2U also announced a new Masters of Information Science and Cybersecurity with UC Berkeley - the company has now moved into profit - [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/11/16/berkeley-launches-online-master-of-information-and-cybersecurity.aspx?admgarea=news) and [here](http://www.barrons.com/articles/2u-can-grow-revenue-over-30-a-year-1479385262)

Walden University launches online Bachelors degree in Science teaching in elementary school - Walden are a for-profit college and part of the 80-strong Laureate network (who also partner with Liverpool University). Teaching is considered a growth area (including by 2U)  - [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/11/18/walden-u-launches-online-elementary-ed-bachelor.aspx?admgarea=news)

 

 

UKHE (UK Higher Education)

Higher Education Research Bill meets with approval  - Albeit not ecstatic. Writing in WonkHE Jo Johnson outlined amendments based on feedback including: Strengthening the OFS (Office for Students) that will ensure student welfare across the HE system. Secondly £4.7bn in research funding to be distributed between 2017-2021. Thirdly, part of the funding will be allocated through ‘Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund’ which is modelled on the US Defence fund (DARPA). DARPA has been critical in driving large scale technological innovations (such as the internet) that have been the platform for business success - [here](http://wonkhe.com/blogs/comment-why-amended-higher-education-research-bill/) and [here](http://wonkhe.com/blogs/policy-watch-autumn-statement-2016/)

India, it’s not me it’s you - Jo Johnson ws on the defensive for the government after the underwhelming India summit and the halving of Indian students studying in the UK(since 2010). Jo Johnson argued some of the blame lay with India noting their failure to recognise UK one-year Masters as qualifications that were also responsible for drops in numbers - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/jo-johnson-addresses-appg-speaks-on-india/)

A CBI/University of Middlesex report calls for closer Anglo-Chinese university links - The report is part of a post-Brexit vision for the UK (The CBI took a strong Remain stance) and argues the UK’s already well developed links with 90K students studying at UKHE is a platform for further ties. The focus is on Transnational Education (TNE), effectively a campus of a foreign university in a country and further partnerships. 4 out of 5 UK universities (surveyed) have expansion plans for TNE or joint programmes with China - [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/look-china-after-brexit-cbi-advises-uk-universities) and [here](http://www.cbi.org.uk/index.cfm/_api/render/file/?method=inline&fileID=BBC0D1C0-84C7-43F6-89A72E3C3D46D2B0)

TNE expands globally - 249 International branch campuses exist globally across 70 countries with 180K students , the UK and the US are the main drivers with China the top destination - [here](http://www.cbi.org.uk/index.cfm/_api/render/file/?method=inline&fileID=BBC0D1C0-84C7-43F6-89A72E3C3D46D2B0)

UK now eligible country for Argentine national scholarships - Around 100-150 are awarded each year for exceptional students and it’s indicative of a thaw in relations that began when Mauricio Macri became President - [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/argentinian-scholarship-scheme-hosted-british-universities)

 

International Education

Australian HE is a 20bn (AUD) a year industry - Now Australia’s third largest export industry, the education sector raised 20.3bn in 2015/16 of which 14bn was from HE. 1 in 4 students at Australia’s top universities are from abroad and they are hoping to capitalise on a Brexit/Trump cocktail to snag even more students. In this vein, Queensland announced plans to double international students in 2026 to 190K - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/23/international-education-20-billion-industry-australia) and [here](http://thepienews.com/news/aus-qld-aims-to-double-intl-students-by-2026/)

Where do African Students study? Africans make up 10.4% of international students, a number set to grow given the the young population (continent-wide median age is 20). Top destinations are France (26.5%) South Africa (9.5%) UK (9.3%) USA (9.3%) Germany (4%) Saudi Arabia (3.7%) Canada (3.4%)  with top sending countries: Nigeria, Morocco, Algeria, Cameroon. 

The groups can be thought of in four categories: Francophone countries predominantly go to France, Anglophone e.g. Nigeria sends to UK or US.  There is rising inter-African study and finally a small but growing portion of students make use of Islamic scholarships to places like Saudi Arabia - [here](http://www.campusfrance.org/fr/ressource/la-mobilit%C3%A9-internationale-des-%C3%A9tudiants-africains)

Canadian international student numbers up 8% to 353K - China makes up 34% of the number with India second at 14%, Nigeria is the key country - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/canada-international-students-up-8-but-growth-slowing/)

ICEF launches Irish agent training course - ICEF, an agent training and service company are setting up training for Ireland, this follows Ireland’s HE growth strategy - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/icef-launch-irish-education-agent-course/)

 

USHE

US International student numbers grow 7% to 1m but some lead indicators suggest slowing growth - International students number have grown but intensive English language training, which is usually done prior to undergraduate, saw falling enrolments. China sent 328k (up 8.1%) and India 165k (up 24.9%) Saudi Arabia and South Korea 61K each followed by Canadia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Brazil, Japan and Mexico - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/14/annual-open-doors-report-documents-continued-growth-international-students-us-and-us)

What will Higher Ed look like under Trump? Undersecretary Ted Mitchell suggested public universities will need to take up the mantle of a focus on retention, completion as  a Trump administration would not make it a priority and instead focus on bringing the private sector back in. Universities will need to tread carefully, as with Brexit, a febrile atmosphere prevails with Lee Bollinger, President of Columbia University, and Larry Summers both discussing the need for universities to stand up where their values (free speech, equality, scientific research e.g. Climate Change) are directly threatened.  - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/16/whats-future-federal-push-higher-education-innovation) and [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/21/prominent-figures-academe-and-higher-ed-groups-speak-out-about-election-aftermath)

 

Tangents

WonkHE have a history (of sorts) of Open Access in the UK - Following a wonkish summer read, DAvid Willetts was inspired to usher in a new era of economic growth by further democratising academic research. The Finch report soon followed, as the policy case for Open access. It hasn’t been a revolution but Open Access has made substantial ground in democratising research, read on [here](http://wonkhe.com/blogs/analysis-open-access-scholarship-and-the-state/)

LinkedIn’s salary calculator is a tool for coming economy - The tool is a key part of their economic graph and insomuch as it’s accurate (big caveat) should reduce information asymmetry among employers and job seekers alike. 

Who is this really for? The gig economy. It’s effectively wage price information, and freelancers will provide the most data (they change jobs more frequently by definition) and their work is more easily priced (either fixed length or deliverables) making the data more accurate. Such a tool can help employers looking to price work and job seekers looking to be hired - [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2016/11/02/linkedin-debuts-its-salary-tool-taking-on-glassdoor-and-payscale/#2ff3b4396ce8)
