Hi all

 

All views expressed in these reports are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of FutureLearn.

As promised I included a very short survey in this fortnight’s report. Please do fill it out it is a mere 4 questions long.

[SURVEY](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BPZZW8V)

 

The big stories

- Coursera switch to subscriptions for their Specializations 
- Udacity and Coursera begin primetime TV advertising as their learner value increases 
- Recruitment Special: Why recruitment is the next big opportunity for MOOC platforms 

 

State of the MOOCS

Coursera’s pivot to subscription - In what is surely a paradigmatic switch, Coursera have announced all their Specializations (groups of courses with a capstone project at the end) will become subscription only, bringing them in line with Udacity whose Nanodegrees are also subscription based. Something that was literally predicted in the last report.

The decision came after an experiment conducted earlier this year which showed subscribers to Specializations had a 2.5x higher completion rate compared with those who purchased the whole Specialization outright. Subscription will be per Specialization, the price range will be between $39 and $89 per month vs the previous per Specialization course price range of $19-99. 

Why paradigmatic? Subscription is already prevalent across Edtech - Udacity, OpenClassrooms, Lynda etc already use it but MOOCs have up to this point preferred to monetise per course. Specializations were Coursera’s flagship approach to his model, like Nanodegrees for Udacity they are Coursera’s primary revenue generating tool. Coursera’s move follows what appears to be an exhaustive push to make themselves financially sustainable based on the per course certificate sales model. Coursera used: Pre-pay (purchasing the certificate before the the course starts), ID verification, Business oriented and business endorsed courses, variable pricing, Capstone projects and most recently withholding assessment (in effect paid for assessments) and feedback from non-fee paying users. Despite this it appears Coursera have decided their financial future lies with subscription - [here](http://coursera.tumblr.com/post/152555853192/introducing-subscriptions-for-specializations)

Edtech hits the primetime as TV advertising commences - Udacity and Coursera are both now advertising on primetime TV. Udacity are now advertising across San Francisco, Austin and Seattle while Coursera are advertising in prime time across CNN and other major networks. TV is often used by universities for recruitment - but universities unlike MOOCs can afford a high cost per acquisition because tuition fees are relatively high. Coursera and Udacity’s decision to go for TV advertising means they perceive the lifetime value of their learners to have crossed the threshold that makes this channel financially viable. Given a recent Pew Study showed US awareness of MOOCs was only at [31%](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/03/22/the-internet-plays-less-of-a-role-in-lifelong-learning-for-those-with-lower-levels-of-education-and-income/) they may feel there is plenty of room for lucrative expansion - [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/udacity-tv-commercial/) and [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/udacity-tv-commercial/)

Coursera to offer accredited professional courses - In keeping with their pivot to business (see[Coursera for Business](https://www.coursera.org/enterprise)) Coursera will offer: Rice University – Engineering Management and Leadership ($4,000) and Vanderbilt University Management Fundamentals ($2,475) - edX already offer such courses e.g. New York Institute of Finance's Risk Management.

Coursera and Udemy release surveys underlining the need for people to take more of their courses - In close proximity, Udemy the and Coursera both released surveys focusing on employee engagement and skill development. Udemy’s survey focused on ‘employee engagement’ and found that 53% of employees in the US were ‘bored’ and wished they employer paid for more training. Coursera’s report ‘Generation Never’ focused on British millennial workers. The PR researchshowed only 14% were satisfied with workplace training and 39% felt their skills were becoming less relevant. Cynicism aside the reports are useful in outlining an anxious generation concerned with skill erosion - [here](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161026005574/en/Udemy-Study-Discovers-Lack-Learning-Opportunities-Leaves) and [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/learninghubs/images/Coursera%20-%20The%20Rise%20of%20Generation%20Never%20in%20the%20UK.pdf)

Udacity are on course to make $24m in profit this year - Udacity have been making excellent progress including their $1bn valuation in their last funding round and a rapid increase in their revenue -   [here](http://fortune.com/2016/10/25/udacity-ibm-amazon-ai/)

Udacity and edX trademark their qualifications - Nanodegrees (Udacity) and Micromasters (edX) have both been trademarked. The move allows the companies to control licensing of the term and underlines the ambition to create a new qualification that is equivalent to ¼- ½ of a master’s degree, ideal they think for a digitally native professional. - [here](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-11-03-why-udacity-and-edx-want-to-trademark-the-degrees-of-the-future-and-what-s-at-stake-for-students)

Georgia Tech and McGraw-Hill will make undergraduate courses available on edX - Apart from being MOOCs, the online courses will be tested on 50 Georgia Tech undergraduates in Spring 2017, If successful (i.e. in learning outcomes and satisfaction) they aim to scale it up to allow 20-25% of undergraduate studies to be done online. Georgia Tech also have plans in the near future to award credit for their courses.  McGraw-Hill will use this venture to try and pivot away from textbooks - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/02/georgia-institute-technology-award-credit-through-massive-open-online-course).

University of Oxford joins edX -  University of Oxford has joined edX with their first course due to start in February 2017 on economic development. Although a coup of sorts for edX it has the feeling of the cool kid who arrives at the party having overestimated the meaning of ‘fashionably late’. Oxford’s decision leaves just just Cambridge and LSE among the top ranked UK universities who lack a MOOC presence - [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37975359)

Babson, a private business college, will launch an entrepreneur focused Xseries on edX - [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/11/08/babson-college-partners-with-edx-to-launch-online-entrepreneurship-courses.aspx)

OpenClassrooms to offer tech degree in the UK - OpenClassrooms the French Edtech platform have supplemented their expansion in the UK with a degree offering. The degree follows their French degree offering from [IESA Multimédia](http://www.iesamultimedia.fr/) - a private college that offers Engineering, Design or Digital Marketing - [here](https://openclassrooms.com/formation-chef-de-projet-multimedia?utm_source=affilinet&utm_medium=cpa&utm_campaign=Premium&484633-72705X1553005X4f043b30ee2ef184e595450d5c5b8c8c&affmt=2&affmn=1)

 

 

Edtech

Georgia State University uses big data analytics to improve student support and graduation - The public university, which has over 24,000 students many of whom are from poorer backgrounds, has been using a new analytics toolkit to identify at risk students and intervene early. The analytics has been coupled with increased student support services thus reducing the ratio of students to student support advisers whilst targeting the at risk students more efficiently. The result have been impressive, with $12m in tuition fees saved through faster graduation and higher graduation rates - [here](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/30/499200614/how-one-university-used-big-data-to-boost-graduation-rates)

LinkedIn Learning ramps up for enterprises - LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda) has now added its enterprise offering. The enterprise offering allows Learning and Development managers to create customised learning paths and track employee progress among their 9,000 courses - [here](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/can-linkedin-learning-help-train-your-employees/)

WeBind seeks to help Indian graduates employability - The app aims to resolve Indian graduates poor employability record by hosting webcasts and lectures from industry professionals to raise help graduates bridge the gap of academic and industry skill requirements. The app is part of the wider trend across academia of making academic courses more closely related to industry skills gaps - other variants have included mid degree internships (such as in Canada) or academic-industry collaboration (Denmark). WeBind has around 40K students, 300 colleges and counts Facebook and other tech companies among its professionals - [here](http://edtechreview.in/news/2563-webind-platform-for-industry-academia-collaboration-india)

Should Edtech be an academic discipline? Eddie Maloney, a Professor of English at Georgetown and head of Centre for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, argues yes - citing the need for theoretical frameworks, dedicated research and peer review  and more accountability. Others argue it already is and/or question whether it’s a good idea for it to become it’s own separate discipline - [here](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-11-09-which-edtech-companies-are-producing-the-best-research-based-products)

In a timely coincidence, Digital Promise, a not for profit, has launched a report asking EdTech companies to demonstrate what research if any, their technology is based upon.The move is clearly welcome in holding Edtech accountable (especially to silicon valley hype) - [here](http://er.educause.edu/blogs/2016/11/edtech-plus-academia-two-worlds-collide)

Facebook come under pressure to sift truth from falsehood after the US election - After accusations that false stories undermined the US election, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg moved to defend Facebook by arguing 99% of facebook news stories that were shared were true. Despite their CEO’s protestations, Facebook staff have set up work teams to tackle the problem. While not directly relevant to MOOCs, it points to the growing prominence of tech companies in how people access news and knowledge and the difficulty in being ‘neutral’ - [here](http://arstechnica.co.uk/business/2016/11/zuckerberg-claims-1-percent-facebook-posts-fake-news-trump-election/)

 

OPM (Online Programme Management) & LMS (Learning Management systems)

LMS providers demo new technology as accessibility issues give pause for thought

Accessibility - ‘[a lawsuit waiting to happen](http://www.educationdive.com/news/thursday-at-educause-2015-campus-computing-project-google-and-cios/408263/)’ - Blackboard acquired UK Edtech firm ‘Fronteer’ who specialise in accessibility. This is topical as edX partner UC Berkeley is still working through a lawsuit from the Department of Justice on the accessibility of its courses.

What’s hot in LMS education? Desire2Learn’s new LMS ‘Brightspace’ will include: intelligent assistants that provide instant feedback on submitted assessment, virtual classroom tools such as polling, file-sharing and status icons and a video recording tool for assignments.

Transcripts, portfolios and modular technologies were demo’d by Cengage (an LMS provider) while Citrix, an enterprise software company, are developing their own virtual classroom - [here](http://www.educationdive.com/news/6-ed-tech-products-to-note-from-educause-2016/429723/) and [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/10/27/d2l-updates-brightspace-lms-with-new-virtual-classroom-tools.aspx?admgarea=News)

 

UKHE (UK Higher Education)

The Higher Education Funding Council (HEFCE) has posted a negative outlook for the UK Higher Education sector. The report was written up prior to Brexit but notes that UKHE’s average surpluses are set to fall, that the population of 18 year olds in the UK is set to decline and that degree apprenticeships may well divert some students away fro degrees. 

Furthermore, they noted most universty growth strategies were built off increased international students, early data suggests Brexit has already dampened EU student applications to UK universities - It dropped 9% compared with the UCAS round last year (although it fell 3% in the previous year) - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/elite-universities-uk-china-strive-collaboration/)and[here](http://wonkhe.com/blogs/getting-worse-hefces-bleak-prognosis-for-university-finances/)

Higher Education at forefront of Anglo-Indian trade talks - May’s visit to India, designed to showcase a post-Brexit trade future ran into difficult ground as Indian demands for more open student visas were rejected. In 2010 the UK took 68K Indian students, a number that dropped to 12K in 2016 much of this stems from a clamping down of post-study work options. The trade impasse results from May’s desire to include students in net immigration - a number she has promised to bring down.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that, Education “would define our engagement suggests this impasse will prove difficult to cross  - [here](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21709964-prime-minister-returns-empty-handed-her-first-long-haul-jaunt-cooler-climate?zid=306&ah=1b164dbd43b0cb27ba0d4c3b12a5e227)

UK Government opens consultation on credit transfer and accelerated degrees - The focus of the consultation is on accelerated degrees and degree switching. The hypothesis is that the old format of a degree as a 3 or 4 year course taken by 18-21 year olds is insufficiently flexible.

Implicit in ‘switching’ are credits that would allow multiple modules to be stacked across institutions. The move should enable more flexibility for people who wish to finish faster, work part time or continue education afterwards. However a key obstacle will be how courses from different ranked universities are awarded credit, although it should be noted that the is ranking conscious and enables credits.

Modularisation and flexibility could be a boon to Edtech providers as it would likely make integration of MOOCs and other digital options easier- [here](http://wonkhe.com/blogs/analysis-degrees-choice-credit-transfer-institutional-autonomy/)

UK Russell Group universities and China 9 (an equivalent) agree to deepen cooperation - The focus will be on including academic exchanges and joint research funding applications - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/elite-universities-uk-china-strive-collaboration/)

 

International Education

USHE

Donald Trump likely to dampen international student numbers to US - In a little covered event, Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States. 

It is likely that his anti-immigration rhetoric and hawkish stance on trade (particularly towards China) may put off some international students, indeed China has already threatened to stem the flow of its students to the US in the event of punitive trade tariffs. Who would benefit? Among the chief beneficiaries would probably be Australia which has made conscious and successful efforts to open its sector to internationalisation- [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/08/trump-victory-will-be-jolt-higher-education) and [here](http://arstechnica.co.uk/business/2016/11/china-threatens-end-iphone-sales-if-trump-imposes-stiff-tariffs/)

Invest more in career paths to improve social mobility - In its latest report, Bridgespan Group,a consultancy that works with ‘mission-driven organisations’ (e.g. not for profits and social enterprises) argues that charities should be looking to invest in career support and pathways to help poorer students. The report fits into a wider narrative, especially in the US, where high tuition fees are making students and regulators more demanding for higher education to demonstrate the ROI to its students - [here](http://www.educationdive.com/news/career-pathways-can-engage-students-and-set-them-up-for-success/429721/)

 

International students update

- ICEF Agents surveys shows drop in support for US and UK Higher education - theannual survey showed that the US and the UK had both dropped in attractiveness (the US survey was conducted before the US election) - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/us-uk-slip-2016-icef-i-graduate-agent-barometer/) 
- 74% of International students who applied to Australian universities did so through agents - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/auidf-74-intl-students-aus-apply-agents/) 

What are the top skills to get you hired? Clue, they all involve computers - LinkedIn released its annual ‘Top skills that can get you hired’ the list was heavy on IT subjects such as: Cloud distributed computing, Data Science, Web Architecture, Middleware and User Interface Design - [here](http://www.slideshare.net/linkedin/the-top-skills-that-can-get-you-hired-in-2017?ref=https://mspoweruser.com/linkedin-reveals-the-top-skills-that-can-get-you-hired-in-2017/)

A pivot to Latin America? - Bruno Marche at the UCL Institute of Education calls for a debate around the internationalisation of Higher Education in Latin America in order to prepare graduates for a more international future and address the shortage of HE that holds back many countries. 

Marche notes both private and public sector initiatives are needed and that the continent is well placed given the prevalence of distance education (15-20% of all HE enrolments are distance (in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico), relatively high internet penetration (~50%) although Marche concedes English language is still an obstacle - [here](http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20161102115315212)

 

Recruitment special

You’re Hired! - Why the recruitment market is the next major battleground for MOOCs

This month Job Today - a recruitment platform startup  raised $20m, bringing the total venture capital funding in recruitment platforms up to $86m for the year. Job Today allows candidates to make profiles, instantly apply for jobs  and also have livechats with potential employers.

Job Today have over 2m user, focusing on Hospitality, Services and Retail they count McDonalds, Starbucks and Holiday Inn among their employers. It is the latest tilt by tech firms to disrupt what is a highly lucrative industry; the recruitment market globally is estimated to have annual revenues of [$450bn](http://www.recruiter.co.uk/news/2016/03/ciett-global-recruitment-industry-sees-86-annual-growth/) - and while firms often have limited training budgets - their hiring budgets tend to be far larger - banks and consultancies frequently offer bonuses in the thousands for employees who successfully recommend someone to join.

It is precisely for this reason that recruitment platforms will not be alone in their hunt for a slice of this market. The first and most prominent is LinkedIn who announced in September 2013 their intention to merge job seekers and employers through their social network in what CEO Jeff Weiner called the ‘[Economic Graph](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/09/09/jeff-weiner-linkedin-is-building-a-massive-global-economic-graph/#7c67aa346394)’. LinkedIn’s product has been ticking along without exactly transforming the job market - yet Facebook’s announcement [this month](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/07/jobbook/) to allow recruitment on their platform suggests they too see opportunity. Facebook will leverage their 1.7bn users and new enterprise offering - Facebook for business - to entice employers and job seekers onto the platform. 

While Facebook’s sheer ubiquity may prove advantageous, it is LinkedIn’s acquisition of Lynda that should give Edtech platforms optimism. LinkedIn’s acquisition of Lynda suggested a missing link - namely the skill gap between what the seeker had and the employer wanted - by offering both the market places for job seekers and employers and the learning resources, LinkedIn aim to monetise the whole value chain as well as capture critical information on skill supply and demand. Their merged product ‘LinkedIn Learning’ is the product of this acquisition and has been rolled out rapidly this year.

If LinkedIn have networks and learning, and Facebook have ubiquity - what chance have Edtech? As Udacity have shown, MOOC platforms may well be able to take a slice of the market by focusing - as ever - on the knowledge intensive industries that tertiary education supports. Both Udacity and Coursera initially tried to create job opportunities - Coursera quietly deprecated their recruitment tool after a lack of interest and Udacity initially did likewise. However, after Udacity’s  pivot to Computer Science based Nanodegrees, Udacity hired a VP for Careers and began developing premium services to support learners such as careers fairs around the silicon valley area, eportfolios and CV support to help graduates showcase their skills and recently added Nanodegree Plus which guarantees job opportunities (with caveats). Udacity are doubling down on this strategy, their most recent Nanodegree - in self-driving cars - is not just supplying a highly in-demand skill but is expected to directly help automotive companies (BMW, HCL and Next EV)  who are unused to recruitment of software engineers. 

If it endures, Udacity’s model of connecting learners to courses that reflect real skill demand and then connecting employers to those learners is sweet spot for Edtech profitability. It marries the needs of employers with the aspirations and means to fulfil those aspirations of learners captures this value chain within Udacity’s platform. Such a model requires 4 elements: an online learning platform, learners, universities and/or businesses. Coursera currently have 3 of those and their enterprise offering - Coursera for Business may be the means to capture the 4th.

 

A little extra to read (if the above did not satiate you)

How do we learn in the age of digital distraction? NPR interview Adam Gazzaley, a Professor of Neurology at University of California San Francisco, whose new book “The Distracted Mind” explores issues such as distraction, multitasking and the role of technology in the classroom - [here](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/11/05/498477634/learning-in-the-age-of-digital-distraction)

The case for investment in public universities - Michael Fabricant of City University New York has argued that austerity (namely cuts to public funding of public universities in the US) has contributed to to the decline of social mobility. Fabricant argues for a holistic investment in public universities to better serve the poor, help them get work and for Edtech to be open (i.e. an open resource that can be customised) and a tool to improve learning not just for cost cutting - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/02/qa-authors-book-austerity-public-higher-education)
