Hi all

This is the tinyletter format of the education intelligence format. Apologies for those who have already read this - I wanted to ensure that those who wanted access to the embedded URLs could access them. There won't be any spamming going forwards!

Many thanks and as ever if you have feedback please do get in touch.

_All views expressed in these reports are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of FutureLearn._

**The big 3**

- LinkedIn Learning has launched integrating Lynda courses into their platform with a view to offering people new jobs, how to get those jobs and for the employer - employees with the right skills to do those jobs
- ePortfolios go from strength to strength as vendors, Venture capitalists and even governments begin to look to them as a new digital backpack
- edX launch two new business models in their bid to become financially sustainable via accreditation and additional services (premium marking options)

 

**MOOCS**

edX have launched two business models as CEO Anant Agarwal’s long-stated push to become financially sustainable through offering academic credit or credit style courses takes shape

- edX roll out Micromasters -  Last year edX piloted a ‘Micromasters’ in supply chain management run by MIT pitching it as a new form of qualification. edX have subsequently launched 19 micromasters. They cover key work-skill courses such as UX and Project Management. Notably they are lumped under ‘programs’ with the Xseries -[here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/20/mooc-based-masters-degree-initiative-expands-globally)

- The micromasters consists of 4-10 MOOCs each and pave the way for full masters programs. Modules taken online count towards the full masters and completing them successfully will be factored into the application process 
    - Micromasters will be available as open access MOOCs but with a difference - paying learners will get their work marked by an instructor - non-paying will have their work peer reviewed
    - The decision to expand them was based on a successful supply chain micromasters where 3,500 of 27,000 learners decided to pay

- Analysis - The most interesting part of Micromasters is the premium instructor marking  option - a halfway house of the full digital MOOC and the on-campus experience. Dan Butin at Inside Higher Ed does some back of the envelope calculation and works out:If edX can get 1,000 people to pay the $300 they will get $300K per course. Assuming this generates enough marking for 25 TAs at $7,500 that would cost $187,500 - yielding them a net profit of around $100K (factoring in other costs). This would be very lucrative and as Udacity have previously shown is a scalable service - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-gamma/moocs-and-beyond)
- Accessibility requirements could cause Berkeley to pull all their online material - Department of Justice has launched a lawsuit against Berkeley for not making all their courses accessible e.g. captions for deaf learners,  and audio for those with visual impairments. Berkeley are looking to work with the DOJ to resolve this  - were it to go through it would have severe implications for the edTech industry at large - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/20/berkeley-may-remove-free-online-content-rather-complying-disability-law)
- Imperial College London has signed up with edX - the first courses will be with Imperial’s business school who will offer 4 introductory MBA courses - [here](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_9-8-2016-9-47-0)

Coursera pivot to the professional learners market with the launch of their B2B model  - Coursera for Business - was launched in August aimed as the enterprise service for the MOOC platform - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/coursera-moves-into-corporate-online-training/)

- Coursera will open up their 1,200 + courses to businesses while providing a comprehensive enterprise service covering: Certificates, tracking, centralised billing, cohort support and even LMS integration
- Coursera have already signed up L'Oréal,Axis Bank, BNY-Mellon and boston Consulting Group
- Analysis:  All the major MOOC platforms have been engaged in the B2B market - Coursera feel they have sufficient pipeline to make a public and formal business model out of it. The market is said to be worth $12bn today - rising to $31bn by 2020 although estimates vary considerably

 

Udacity launch more courses and founder Sebastian Thrun sheds light on his motivation

- Udacity launch their self-driving car nanodegree in conjunction with Mercedes-benz, Nvidia, Otto and Didi (the chinese Uber). Interestingly, it will not be subject to Udacity’s ‘money back guarantee - [here](https://campustechnology.com/Articles/2016/09/21/Udacity-Unveils-Nanodegree-Program-for-SelfDriving-Car-Engineers.aspx) and [here](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-09-13-udacity-teams-up-with-mercedes-benz-to-offer-self-driving-education-literally)
- Thrun explains why he left Google to found  Udacity - he realised there was a supply shortage of niche but soon to be huge skills (namely in machine learning areas such as self driving cars and data science) hard to fault his logic - [here](https://campustechnology.com/Articles/2016/09/21/Udacity-Unveils-Nanodegree-Program-for-SelfDriving-Car-Engineers.aspx)

Swayam launches - Swayam launches - [edtechreview.in](http://edtechreview.in/) and Class Central are not impressed - India’s much heralded - long delayed MOOC platform has launched after being built by Microsoft for $6m. Swayam stands for Study webs of active learning for young aspiring minds (a truly disappointing acronym) - [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/swayam-initiative-india-moocs/) and [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/swayam-beta/)

- Pros - 2,000 courses will eventually run on the platform and no university can refuse credit gained through taking its MOOCs
    - Courses range from undergraduate to graduate with each credit equivalent to 13-15 hours of instruction. Indian HEIs can offer up to 20% of their catalogues on Swayam

- Cons - Despite claims to be an international platform, an Indian phone number is required, the design some would argue is rather dated andit has (according to [edtechreview.in](http://edtechreview.in/)) been poorly marketed

Kadenze - the creative arts MOOC platform -  adds two new partners: Columbia University and Berklee College of Music to join their illustrious group that also includes Princeton and Stanford - [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/kadenze-columbia-berklee/)

The Computer Scientists have left the building - Of the three original founders - Andrew Ng left for Baidu, Sebastian sort of left (became chair at Udacity and now Daphne has returned to academia too. Daphne Koller joining Alphabet’s Calico (a Machine Learning healthcare startup). It could just be coincidence but it may also reflect the switch of MOOC platforms to businesses to be scaled perhaps a less interesting challenge for the founders - [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/daphne-koller-coursera-calico/)

What do NYT, Forbes and Wired magazine all have in common? If you answered media you’d be right but the answer I was looking for was that they all offer MOOCs - this follows on from Vogue Magazines partnership with Parsons School of Design - media outlets are experimenting with turning their brand and expertise into an education business model - [here](https://www.class-central.com/report/forbes-nyt-sothebys-common-make-onine-courses/)

 

**EdTech**

LinkedIn Learning opens up a new front in professional education  - LinkedIn have launched their first integration of LinkedIn with Lynda - called LinkedIn Learning. The service offers Lynda courses to users seeking jobs and will be $29.99 per month or free with LinkedIn premium. The integration will be further enhanced when LinkedIn (mercifully) complete the overhaul of their website UI. Lynda will in addition also operate as a separate entity for now. [Here](http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/22/linkedin-reveals-what-its-doing-with-lynda-com-linkedin-learning/) and [here](http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/31/lynda-coms-new-learning-path-program-plans-the-courses-needed-to-land-the-job-you-want/)

- LinkedIn’s advantage lies in the way you think and access courses more than the courses themselves - in a sea of learning material that could be a very powerful USP
    - Learning paths - LinkedIn will take advantage of Learning paths - a tool Lynda pioneered. Lynda currently has 53 of these paths - each of which shows the skills required to get to one of 53 jobs (remarkably, all the skills are available on Lynda) 
    - Reverse learning paths - LinkedIn can also do the reverse and aims to -  it can show you where your skills can take you - leveraging its data to do so e.g. people that take course X end up in job Y
    - Painting a more detailed future - LinkedIn also aim to show  supporting data  - e.g. how much demand there is for a job or skill and by which companies, what the salaries are, where are the jobs based, how many other people have taken this course

- Analysis: LinkedIn talking the good talk - All of this isn’t news to those familiar with LinkedIn’s ambitions for a an ‘economic graph’ the idea that the job market (supply, demand, skills gaps and the matching process) could all be done via LinkedIn. The challenge is putting this into a compelling product people actually wanted to use or better yet pay for. LinkedIn didn’t manage to get sufficient people to pay for it - hence the need for a buy-out by Microsoft, we’ll see if the latter can have a better swing - but don’t hold your breath

The CV is Dead! Long Live the Portfolio!-  ePortfolio companies have made impressive ground as governments, universities and employers increasingly look to equip and differentiate their students/employees/citizens with a more granular and realistic portrayal of their capabilities. Eduventures argued as much noting their recent summit saw unprecedented interest in eportfolios and attribute the rise of this to two factors

- Growing market size - There are now over 30 vendors of eportfolios including all the major LMS providers and in September eportfolio company Portfolium closed a funding round of $6.2m in September. Portfolium claim an eportfolio is a far better predictor of performance and work with over 200 universities, 3.75m students and over 60K employers including Oracle, Viasat, Nike, Intel , SPACEX!!! (always exciting) Boeing, Cisco and Disney etc - [here](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/portfolium-raises-6-2-million-to-get-college-students-into-jobs-where-theyll-kick-butt/)
- Deepening market - Eduventures noted that eportfolios were moving beyond universities and colleges to schools and as an employer tool. Anecdotal reports also suggest the UK government is looking to create portfolios for students - [here](http://www.eduventures.com/2016/09/two-trends-driving-change-eportfolio-market/) (doesn’t include UK gov reference)

Pearson aim to be the ‘Netflix of education’ - CTO of Pearson Alfred Hitchcock is pushing for integration of the company’s diverse range of services, standards and credentials. 

- Analysis - The move is logical - but raises bigger questions - Pearson have a string of products but not an ecosystem because their digital products are for the large part not integrated - by extension for a digitising company - their business as whole is not integrated (think how fun Google would be if it weren’t for single sign on)

 

**Edtech Finance**

A number of big funding rounds were concluded recently -

- South African Media Giant Naspers invests $90m in Edtech in June 2016 - Naspers funded both Udemy - who received $60m - and Codeacademy who received $30m - [here](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/12/codecademy-the-free-online-coding-school-raises-another-30m-led-by-naspers/)
- OpenClassrooms raised €6m - The funds will increase their offerings of Diplomas and spearhead their expansion into the UK market - [here](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/openclassrooms-chalks-up-6m-in-new-funding/)
- iVersity received funding from Holtzbrinck digital - iVersity aim to create digital degrees and textbooks (Holtzbrinck’s business)
- BYJU raise $50m - The funds bring their total to $134m and will help them expand their core business model of exam preparation and learning paths across school and college education - [here](https://yourstory.com/2016/09/byju-funding-chan-zuckerberg-initiative/)
- Analysis - The rounds above present an uptick on an overall drop in edTech funding on 2015 which was a [peak year](https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/global-ed-tech-deals-funding-q2-2016/). 
    - Funds are flowing to emerging markets - iTutorGroup (China) and BYJU (India) both had huge funding rounds with the latter the largest to date in the India edTech scene. It’s somewhat chicken and egg - edTech is surging in India and China so funding follows so edTech surges
    - Why are Media groups investing? - If Naspers’ Larry Illg is indicative - “Education is important to every economy in the world. But it hasn’t had it’s internet moment yet” - Times of India who invested in Coursera pitched it more as an opportunity to service the vast and under-resourced Indian tertiary education market - either way - they see huge potential and are funding accordingly

Wiley acquire ranku - Online Program Management provider Wiley have acquired Ranku. Ranku specialises in recruitment - analysing and converting web traffic into applications for education programmes - [here](http://www.educationinvestor.co.uk/(A(0H1T08BR0QEkAAAANDFlNGRkNGUtNjI0ZS00ZWZkLWE4ZTAtNjFkM2VmNDJhY2VhAY8vNesawM7fyKOuS6ednRZMNno1)S(4hydv0afqc0wfubaqodbtm45))/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=5637)

- Analysis - A sensible move by Wiley - Ranku are a seattle based startup and believed the OPM market was ripe for unbundling by focusing their efforts on using analytics and website design to optimise admission portals. They’ve proven their value to Wiley - although ironically not their vision of an unbundled market

 

**OPM (Online Programme Management)**

Pathways continue to expand in the US while deepening their reach - A recent deal between Rutgers and King’s education - a UK pathway provider - points to the increasing competition in the market

- The deal saw King’s Education provide a pathway (an on-campus preparation course for would-be international students  typically (9 months long). King’s Education are likely responsible for recruitment to the school - the students of which will pay the lucrative international student fees at Rutgers
- US universities  have been steadily embracing pathway programs as a way to increase their international student intake - with the pathway provider usually establishing a separate campus and take on responsibility for recruitment. A recent report by Cambridge Education Group (another UK pathway provider) recently found the industry in English speaking countries to be worth $1.4bn per year and found 52% of public colleges were using or had plans to use pathways
- Expansion is typical but what marks the Rutgers deal out is the age range. The pathway will be situated within Rutgers preparatory school - a US high school covering ages 13-17 which means the students effectively are being recruited for Rutgers as young as 13. It suggests other universities may seek to secure their vital international student pipeline at a younger age and strike deals with schools  - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/english-medium-pathways-worth-1-4bn-annually/) and [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/survey/pressure-build-class-2016-survey-admissions-directors)

  

**UKHE (UK Higher Education)**

Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) to launch in 2017 with potentially big implications for English universities - The framework, which the government aims to introduce in 2017 will assess and rank all English universities across three metrics: student satisfaction with teaching, retention and employability. The government argues that it enables students to make more informed choices over how to spend their loans and in turn they will allow universities with top ratings to increase their tuition fee beyond the current £9,000 limit

- Pushback and non-participation - Several universities have doubts citing the administrative burden of gathering the data, and question whether the metrics are not too crude given the importance of the framework
- Implicit in the reservations are to what extent a TEF ranking would impact a university's ranking and reputation? A provisional analysis by THE suggested the likes of Oxford would drop below smaller universities such as Coventry, Loughborough and Swansea - [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/who-suffers-if-leading-universities-opt-out-tef) and [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/teaching-excellence-framework-tef-set-to-reshape-hierarchy-of-uk-higher-education)
    - Analysis: A compromise is the most likely option, Jo Johnson has already indicated he’s willing to negotiate and against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty the government may try and be more conciliatory towards the sector. Would the government want to communicate its flagship universities were ousted by those with less of an international presence?
    - Extra: Simultaneously HEFCE([Higher Education Funding Council for England](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/))  is trialling a number of pilots to improve measurement of teaching - the full list of which is available [here](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/lt/lg/projects/)

UKHE’s push for clarity on students and alternatives on research to help navigate Brexit- Forecasts of the short term cost to UKHE of Brexit have been revised down with an early estimate suggesting only 1-3% of revenue will be lost due to Brexit. However the longer term effects could still be very damaging if UKHE loses out on students, staff and research grants - which in turn could see their rankings and thus desirability slip

- Clarity on the future of EU students - Top of UKHE’s priority list are international students. Universities UK, a lobbying group for UKHE has pushed the government to give clarity as soon as possible on the status of EU students in a Brexit future. This is a very sensitive area as Theresa May has previously been somewhat inimical on the issue - restricting student visas which she regards as a key source of immigration
- However the IPPR, a think tank, has suggested the data the government based its estimates on grossly inflates the number of students who actually stay on after study. Jo Johnson the Universities Minister has acknowledged there are questions over the data and the need for clarity over EU students - [here](http://www.ippr.org/news-and-media/press-releases/government-could-be-targeting-phantom-students) and [here](http://thepienews.com/news/universities-uk-presses-for-clarity-on-eu-student-admissions/)
- Retaining access to research grants and collaboration - A report by the Guardian also noted many UK universities are looking to build EU campuses. This could in theory enable them to bypass Brexit and retain access to EU research funding, and academic staff. However the campuses would need to be compliant with the country and thus their fees would be significantly lower than current UK fees - top candidate countries include Finland, Germany, Ireland and the Baltic states  - [here](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/22/uk-universities-mull-eu-campuses-in-new-era-of-uncertainty)

 

**International Education**

UK tops rankings - unlikely to last - For the first time (in the THE rankings) a UK university - Oxford - took the top spot. This was due to Oxford’s success across the 4 core metrics of teaching, researching, citations and international outlook. UCL was FutureLearn’s top ranked partner - [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/world-university-rankings-2016-2017-results-announced)

- Why short lived? As THE made clear Brexit could have a clear impact on the UK with QS already arguing UK higher Education had suffered reputational damage and if research and/or student intake is harmed this will precipitate a decline. Q’s kept MIT as their top ranked university and ¾ UK institutions dropped in the QS rankings - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/qs-rankings-brexit-uncertainty-dents-uk-position/)
- Asian universities continue to climb - CUHK and KAIST both joined the top 100 and HKUST, Fudan and KH Polytechnical are now in the top 200 - NUS of Singapore reached its highest ever rank of 24th
- India slowly improves- India nearly has a university in the top 200 with the Indian Institute of Science now in the 201-250 group

African Union discusses opening up Higher Education market via student mobility - the aim is to make it easier for africans to study elsewhere in Africa. The move is being positively received but critics note that due to political pressure south Africa has recently restricted student access due to its universities - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/qs-rankings-brexit-uncertainty-dents-uk-position/)

- 
    - Why are some excited? Enabling mobility should improve accessibility of tertiary education by allowing those eligible for tertiary education in countries that lack capacity to study elsewhere in the continent. This is a very pressing issue as the continent is host to some of the youngest populations and very limited university access

**International student news**

- China had 400K international students in 2015/16 - maintaining their remarkable 10% year on year growth in this sector - their latest growth initiative focuses on central asia - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/china-23-intl-students-study-outside-beijing-and-shanghai/)
- Philippines government invests £350K  (plus £150K from British Council) to create a series of transnational education partnerships. These aim to get UK universities to support postgraduate education (mainly joint degrees and twinning) in the Philippines and help their higher education sector internationalise - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/500k-dedicated-to-develop-philippine-tne/)
    - The move is timely - A Cambridge study of 35 countries across South Asia and Sub-saharan africa found that in 31 countries less than 10% of those eligible were in Higher Education and in 20 of the countries less than 5% were. Equal access to higher education is one of the UN’s Sustainable development goals for 2030 and at present seems out of reach - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/16/study-finds-major-access-gaps-higher-education-developing-countries)

- Want international students? Go English - At least the Netherlands has taken this approach with around 60% of undergraduate courses now taught in english. This has led to some complaints around the loss to Dutch culture but the country’s sector is adamant this is critical to internationalise - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/08/dutch-educators-debate-growth-english-instruction-their-universities)

 

**US Education**

Why is college such a key topic in the US election?  The answer lies in the size of student debt and the centrality of higher education to advanced economies future growth. A recent report by the Commission on the Future of Undergraduate Education in the US sheds some light on the current state of the sector:

- Access is high but graduation lags - Although 90% of US High School graduates will attend higher education, graduation is still an issue with only 60% having graduated after 6 years - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/22/more-people-enroll-college-even-rising-price-tag-report-finds)

- Borrowing is up - 50% borrowed in 2000, now 60% do so  and they are borrowing more - a seperate article by [fivethirtyeight.com](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) - a data focused news outlet found that tuition had increased significantly above inflation since 2000 with the primary reason being a decline in state funding - [here](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fancy-dorms-arent-the-main-reason-tuition-is-skyrocketing/)
- Students enrol at more than one college- 35% of students were likely to graduate having attended 2 or more institutions - with a common approach being to 2 + 2 - two colleges of 2 years each
- Why is this relevant? - It’s the economy - Student debt per student and as a whole is rising with a combined debt of over $1tn. The economy needs more graduates - but graduates are rightly concerned about which part of the job market they enter - the low paid, short term contract part or the lucrative part? The issues matters all the more given the size of the debt
- Presidential plans in brief: Clinton plans to massively reduce college costs by making it tuition free for households earning less than $125k, Trump aims to increase competition and tie loans to the likely employability of the student’s choice of degree

 

 **A little extra to read (if the above did not satiate you)**

If the above wasn’t enough - here are some food for thought articles

- Audrey Watters posts her talk on edTech - it’s a long read but well worth it as she explores the history, philosophy and future of education and provides the backstory to those pigeons [spoiler alert the pigeons are central to the argument] - [here](http://hackeducation.com/2016/09/22/pigeon)
- Neil Selwyn of Monash university has an interview with Inside Higher Ed - Neil argues technology is now so central to education that we need to take a step back and critically examine its application and the effects it has - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/09/qa-author-book-how-technology-changing-education)
