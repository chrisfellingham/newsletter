Hi all

Apologies for the delay in sending this out, there was an issue with tinyletter (the newsletter service this runs off) which has only just been resolved  
  

This will be the final report before a short break over Christmas. The big news is that edX’s MicroMasters are up and running. Like Specializations on Coursera or Nanodegrees on Udacity, MOOC platforms are betting that a series of formally or informally accredited courses will be the key to sustainable revenue for platforms and partners alike.  
  

As ever, if you like it forward it on or share the subscribe link: **[https://tinyletter.com/ChrisFellingham](https://tinyletter.com/ChrisFellingham)**

 

All views expressed in these reports are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of FutureLearn.

Thank you to everyone who provided feedback in the last report!

 

 

State of the MOOCS

12 universities commit to edX’s MicroMasters - edX’s flagship business model is taking shape with 12 universities creating MicroMasters. The Micromaster, a trademarked edX qualification, consists of between 3 to 9 courses that if paid for, count as the first semester of an on-campus masters. If the candidate chooses not to pursue a masters or is not accepted, edX hope the MicroMasters will become a qualification in its own right, a micro-masters, if you will.

Although MicroMasters are similar in structure to Coursera’s Specializations, they are more tightly bound to existing university business models (i.e. degrees). The MicroMasters achieves this by acting as a lead generation for the on-campus course, modularising it and finally reducing its overall cost (effectively skip the living and full tuition costs of one semester). It’s effectively a variant of the ‘online program management’ and early success with MIT suggests it is financially viable. 

MicroMasters may suffer some limitations that Specializations do not. Firstly, as the model has to be structured within a masters, that may give edX less editorial control over which MicroMasters they get and the number of them because a University has to be willing to let MicroMasters be part of that Masters and have the Masters in the first place. Secondly, the transition of an online course to an on-campus one seems to mitigate the very advantages of online learning, namely its convenience. That said, edX perhaps see this as a stepping stone, an easy sell to universities but one which they hope will ultimately see MicroMasters decouple  - [here](https://odl.mit.edu/news-and-events/news/mit-announces-mitx-micromasters-program-development-economics-path-full-masters)

10m Chinese MOOC users underlines depth of demand for education - A new report from the Chinese Ministry of Education and Online Learning underlines the scale of demand in the middle kingdom. The report shows 1,200 MOOCs have been created by around 30 Universities,  around 10% of all universities in China. The report notes that further course production is held back by a lack of marketing and production capacity at universities.

The most popular courses cover the Gaokao exam - the mandatory national exam for university entrance - but somewhat surprisingly vocational and professional courses were more popular than degree courses. The latter insight has lead many to predict that professional and vocational courses will dominate the next wave of online courses in China. This fits with demographic trends as the vast majority of MOOC users are students who were looking to boost their chances in the job market. Of those that paid, the average was $30-45 per course  - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/chinese-mooc-learners-top-10-miilion-year-end/)

Coursera take on more corporates in their ‘employability focused course’ strategy - Coursera has launched two new programs; Data Analytics and Presentation with PwC and Identifying Throat Cancer by Mount Sinai which is accredited by the American Medical Association for CPD (Continuing Professional Development) for US physicians. The move follows earlier efforts with Qualcomm to get more courses geared towards employability. 

Coursera have long used corporates for Specialization projects (coursework at the end of a program) to add credibility but the acquisition of PwC as a partner could suggest a step change in chasing corporates who carry credibility among aspiring professionals. For the corporates, as McKinsey have demonstrated with their own premium-only MOOC platform there are opportunities from premium courses to brand awareness and recruitment- [here](http://www.news-medical.net/news/20161207/Mount-Sinai-introduces-first-ever-Coursera-course-on-HPV-associated-oral-and-throat-cancer.aspx)

Kadenze’s variation on a subscription theme - Kadenze, the creative arts MOOC platform have launched programs - akin to Coursera’s Specializations they will cost around $300-900 and currently they offer 11. Kadenze’s platform differs from others in that they already have a $10 per month membership scheme which is a prerequisite for taking the programs. The advantages would seem to be that they have a stable revenue base at a low cost and then the high price options for one-off or more ambitious users to capture both ends of the price spectrum- [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/11/30/kadenze-adds-accredited-tracks-to-online-arts-ed.aspx?admgarea=news)

Udacity update (In June 2016) - In a recent interview, Sebastian Thrun the founder of Udacity revealed that Udacity has at present around 13K learners enrolled on the Nanodegrees. This implies a monthly revenue of around $2.6m (minus the discount if you complete on time) . Thrun also noted that Udacity Blitz, their small company projects,  has expanded to 250 companies - [here](http://blog.udacity.com/2016/12/udacity-talks-welcomes-padmasree-warrior.html) and [here](http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Google-X-founder-now-at-Udacity-talks-10687730.php)

They have also launched a new fast-track Android certificate program by Google  called ‘Associate Android Developer Certification’ which costs $750 for 3 courses across 3 months - [here](http://blog.udacity.com/2016/12/introducing-associate-android-developer-fast-track-google.html)

Slightly late to this but Udacity run a Udacity talks feature interviews with Silicon Valley CEOs and largely act as advertising and PR for Udacity. 

Job guarantees; Unoriginal, good idea or con? - Udacity’s job placement service, Blitz came under the spotlight this week and reignited the debate on whether ‘job or money back’ guarantees should be part of education offerings. Blitz works by offering graduates of Udacity’s nanodegree a chance to complete short term, paid projects for selected companies - which the company can use to trial a candidate before hiring them (although they are not obliged to do so). 

Marguerite McNeal at EdSurge, thinks it is original and notes many universities offer placement schemes  such as NorthEastern who run a voluntary company project program, or those that offer more formal propositions such as sandwich courses.

So far, so good. Except perhaps not. Inside Higher Ed took a closer look at Udacity plus similar propositions such as coding bootcamps like App Academy and flatiron. Speaking to Inside Higher Ed, Beth Akers of the Manhattan Institute, a think tank, argues that job or money back guarantees are well understood safeguards for those investing in education. The problem is how they are communicated, General Assembly failed an audit in part on how they communicated [job placement rates](http://www.ibtimes.com/code-boot-camps-fail-obama-unaudited-stats-cast-doubt-success-rates-2301188). Udacity are for now exempt from regulation as their courses are below the price threshold in California ($2,500) for regulation. However, as more Edtech companies pursue this avenue the regulatory threshold will likely adapt - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/29/udacity-and-boot-camps-offer-money-back-guarantees-job-placement)

 

Edtech

Salesforce’s training platform Trailhead preparing for bright future - Salesforce, the hugely popular cloud-based CRM platform anticipate demand for their training will rise to 2m by 2020 (currently 300K).  Cloud platforms are no longer a trend - they are business as usual for many sectors of the economy but as digitization increases there will be many more cloud-services that strip out business processes that were once in-house. This will necessitate training as the process and the platform that runs it become linked. Online learning platforms could well fulfil this training market - by the same logic cloud uses - why do an expensive in-house solution when it can be outsourced to a specialist platform? - [here](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/11/15/salesforce-com-gives-its-trailhead-learning-service-a-linkedin-style-makeover/)

Tableau release their ‘State of Data’ report providing a view of data courses across US Higher Education - Unlike Coursera or Udemy’s PR reports this was a substantive review of data courses and degrees across US Higher Education. 

The report found that of the top 150 universities in the US all have at least one data program with some such as University of Washington-Seattle having 46. Tableau compare this with the jobs market and note the programs track the rise of analytics jobs, 60K on indeed.com. Furthermore, provision tracks local demand, universities in regions with more demand like New York, Seattle and Boston have more programs. The report also dug into specifcs - Business Analytics, Business Intelligence and Data Visualisation were becoming more popular as universities moved away from a simple ‘Data science’ provision to a broader curricula that recognises Data Science is now essential to many business processes and so requires communication, presentation and multiplicity of tools -  [here](http://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/media/the_state_of_data_education_in_2016_final.pdf?signin=9d9ffe09b22958ef30d778f4abe8aef3)

IDP expand from student recruitment to job placement - IDP, the Australian student recruitment firm aims to move into the job placement business for its students. IDP currently makes money placing around 30K students annually in universities across 5 countries, with supplementary business models including insurance and accommodation support. IDP’s new business model will aim to ‘complete the journey’ by connecting students with employers (how exactly has yet to be specified). The move is timely as Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail recently found a majority of international students take on low-skilled work after graduation suggesting a mismatch in the labour market. If IDP can improve this that will likely be a service worth paying for, IDP will bet that their ready access to a supply of students will protect them from other competitors - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/idp-employers-in-student-journey/)

University of South Florida will pay for select students to do a coding bootcamp - The university has partnered with RevaturePro Online, an online coding platform. Students and alumni can now apply for a place on the bootcamp and if successful the university will cover their costs. It’s yet another example of universities looking to bridge graduates into the job market to boost employability (Lynn University offered something [similar](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/10/09/lynn-university-and-general-assembly-team-credit-bearing-study-abroad)) - [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/11/29/u-south-florida-to-offer-free-coding-program-bootcamp-to-students-and-alumni.aspx?admgarea=news)

Online Learning Consortium and State University of New York combine to produce a certificate of online teaching excellence (COTE) - The certificate will cost $1,499 in total or $400 per course and is taken over a year, online in a self-paced format - [here](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/12/06/new-certificate-program-trains-in-online-instructional-design.aspx?admgarea=news)

Edtech Finance

Edtech investment down as VC’s demand return on investment - Audrey Watters, an Edtech blogger reflects on Edtech funding in 2016. Overall, funding is down by around 50% (albeit 2015 was a bumper year). Watters argues the drop in funding isn’t just a reversion; layoffs (General Assembly, Treehouse and Noodle) and CEOs moving on (Daphne Koller and Amin Saberi) are proof of VC impatience with Edtech’s progress towards profits - [here](http://hackeducation.com/2016/12/05/top-ed-tech-trends-business)

 

UKHE (UK Higher Education)

How should UKHE approach the issue of international students?  - Vivienne Stern, Director of UK Universities, a universities lobbying group, urges universities to drop their hostility and recognise the issue as a legitimate concern and try and inform the public of the benefits to all. The move is a rapprochement of sorts as the very Pro-Remain Universities UK sector seeks a less antagonistic relationship with May’s government.

Were it simply a matter of building relationships with the new government this would might be feasible but a new report from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) underlines the critical role international students play in English university finances. Fees from international students to rise from £3.6bn in 2014/15 to £4.8bn in 2018/19 around 14.9% increase (excl inflation) and about 12.7% of UK Universities income. Regardless of further regulation that number looks questionable - international student numbers only grew 1% in 2014/15 and UCAS applications for overseas students dropped by 1.1% for 2016/17. 

With early reports suggest the Home Office may be looking at cutting international student numbers from 300K to 170K UKHE is unlikely to let the issue drop as their revenue comes under threat - [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/universities-told-stop-being-antagonistic-overseas-students), [here](http://thepienews.com/news/england-higher-education-international-student-projections-too-optimistic-hefce/) and [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/minister-makes-assurances-2017-18-phd-funding-eu-students)

Independent higher education institutions undecided on TEF strategy - TEF, the Teaching Excellence Framework, is the UK government’s new system for ranking higher education institutions and will determine issues such as whether they can raise tuition fees and possibly their intake of international students. TEF works by submitting a backlog (several years worth) of granular data to help TEF judge institutions but many independent institutions, of which there are around 700, either haven’t been collecting such data or don’t to such a granular level. If they submit what they have, the highest they can achieve is ‘bronze’ some suggest it may be better not to be ranked at all - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/uks-alternative-providers-tef-data-metrics/)

In defence of TEF - Chris Husbands, Vice Chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University and the Chair of TEF mounts a defence of the process. He argues that TEF is not merely a crude ‘metric based’ system but uses a deliberative panel for nuance. However he slightly undermines his case by claiming student outcomes are at the heart of the effort - [here](http://wonkhe.com/blogs/busting-five-common-myths-about-the-tef/)

 

International Education

QS debut Employability rankings for universities - This is the first rankings to make ‘employability’ the focus rather than a contributing factor. The top 10 were Stanford, MIT, Tsinghua, Sydney, Ecole Polytechnique, Columbia, Oxford, Berkeley and Princeton.

How did QS decide what constituted ‘employability’? Reputation among 37K surveyed employers (30%), employment related partnerships, research and non-research (15%), number of employers canvassing on campus (15%), graduate employment rate (10%) with the final outcome, alumni outcomes (30%). The latter is somewhat contentious, QS looked at the top 21K ‘most successful individuals’ (creative, wealthy, entrepreneurial and philanthropic) and tracked which universities they had attended.

The methodology isn’t unreasonable but is evidently open to a number of critiques - such as the list saying more about the economies and regions the universities feed into than their actual education. Furthermore the list of ‘most successful’ seems particularly contentious given it seems to exclude academics and government workers - [here](http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/employability-rankings/2017)

China emerges top of the emerging economies University rankings - THE have released their top emerging economy rankings (out of 300) and China took 6 of the top 10. FutureLearn partner University of Cape Town was 4th. Other results of interest: India rose to 27 spots, Brazil to 25 and Russia to 24 - [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/brics-and-emerging-economies-university-rankings#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/scores_overall/sort_order/asc/cols/stats)

London Business School tops the FT’s European rankings - LBS was followed by HEC Paris, Insead and IE Business school (Barcelona) with St Gallen of Switzerland taking 5th. LBS’s top ranking was based in part on its international student body with 90% overseas from around 60 countries) - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/london-business-school-financial-times-top-european-business-school/) and [here](https://www.ft.com/content/402f3ee4-afe4-11e6-9c37-5787335499a0)

China’s Higher Education sector sets a target of 100K students from South East Asia by 2020 - Although the world’s biggest sender (7-8% of all international students are from China) China has made inbound students a strategic priority. Southeast Asia has over 600m and a middle class that is due to exceed 100m by 2020. International students aren’t just a source of revenue, it helps a country build soft power and prestige and China appears to want to become the destination of choice, at least in Southeast Asia - [here](http://monitor.icef.com/2016/12/china-moving-expand-student-recruitment-southeast-asia/)

Chopras to launch new Indian University in the Himalayan state of Uttarahkhand - The Chopras, an Indian student recruitment firm, is creating its own university that aims to attract 1,500 domestic and international students. The selling point will be very close links between employers and students with fees at around ‘⅓ of UK tuition fees’. The close link with employers is an effort to boost graduate employability for which Indian graduates fare [poorly ](http://monitor.icef.com/2015/10/indias-employability-challenge/)- [here](http://thepienews.com/news/india-chopras-university-himalayas/)

Georgetown has the top ranked alumni network  - The study was done by marketing consultant firm Intead, to reach their conclusion they looked at, among other things, the number of alumni with ‘International’ or ‘Global’ in their title. Tracking alumni progress on LinkedIn does yield insights - LinkedIn’s student app allows such information, the results of this study are however, more dubious - [here](http://thepienews.com/news/georgetown-ranked-top-global-alumni-network/)

Algerian Ministry of Education launches 5 e-masters to tackle chronic youth unemployment - It’s logical move for a country with youth unemployment around 20%. Subjects include ‘Local Administration’ and ‘Finance’, with the e-masters limited to 1,000 places, OpenClassrooms the French provider has had success in North Africa for precisely these reasons - [here](http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20161130145217389)

PISA scores put Singapore top - PISA is a standardised test by the OECD to attempt to compare schooling systems internationally. The latest PISA tested 540K students with Singaporean students coming top overall followed by Japan, Estonia, Taiwan and Finland, the plucky Brits came 15th. The Economist distills; spending works but only up to $50,000 per pupil, truancy is costly and selection by ability appears counterproductive - [here](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisa-2015-results-in-focus.pdf) and [here](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21711319-latest-survey-international-education-should-spur-politicians-reform-their-countries)

USHE

Betsy Devos has been picked as Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Education - Early consensus seems to be that her focus will be on K-12 efforts such as charter schools rather than higher education although she is thought to be supportive of for-profits - [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/28/betsy-devos-trumps-choice-education-secretary-has-unclear-higher-ed-priorities)

UK government releases Longitudinal Earnings Outcome (LEO) data - Dry as it may sound it’s a fascinating resource for understanding the link between university choice (institution and degree) on earnings and by extension social mobility. WonkHE’s snap analysis reveals some stark if depressing insights; the gender pay gap begins immediately after university, Law and Economics are the best bet for a high salary  and ideally you should do them at either Oxford, Cambridge or LSE - [here](http://wonkhe.com/blogs/prior-attainment-gender-gaps-and-other-lessons-from-leo/)
